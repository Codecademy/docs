There are also tags which are used for changing the appearance of tekst on the screen. For example <b>the Bold </b>, and <i>Italic </i>. 

Some examples in usage:
 <p>This is plain tekst (as we know it) - <b>and this text is bold,</b> <i> where by contrast this tekst is italic</i> .</p>
 

You can also mix the tags, which doesn't improve readability, but it is nice to know it is a possibility. For that we nest the tags.
<p><b><i>This is very busy text.</i></b></p>

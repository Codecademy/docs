They are block-level, which means it is as wide as it's parent element and as tall as its content's height.

## Syntax

The pargraph element is enclosed by an opening tag `<p>` and a closing tag `</p>`:

```html
<p>
  This is a block of text! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing
  elit.
</p>
```

## Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div style="width: 50%; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black;">
      <p style="padding: 10px;">
        It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he
        fell madly in love with him. Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain
        in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Represents a break in text. This tag is used when text needs to span multiple lines rather than being in-line, such as an address.

## Syntax

```html
Text that will appear on one line.<br>Text that will appear on the next line.
```

The `<br>` tag will move the text after it to a new line.

## Example

Suppose there is an address that needs to be shown to the user so that they may mail a payment. It is important that the address is formatted in the standard way, to prevent confusion

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <h3>Payment Address:</h3>
    <p>
      5000 Sheffield Street <br>
      Suite #210 <br>
      Smithville Flats, MO, 11110
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

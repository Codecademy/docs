In HTML, **tags** are commonly defined as a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a web page. They are used for making [elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements) for the web page's markup. During the early days of the World Wide Web, tags were responsible for a majority of the web's code.

## Syntax

```pseudo
<element-name> content </element-name>

<self-closing-element-tag />
```

A single tag is made of an opening angle bracket `<`, followed by the `element-name`, followed by the closing angle bracket. While most elements are made of opening and closing tags some are self-closing. Furthermore, some self-closing elements like [`<br>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/br) can have a slash at the end like so: `<br />`. The other self-closing tags include: `<area>`, `<base>`, `<col>`, `<embed>`, `<hr>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, `<keygen>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<param>`, `<source>`, `<track>`, and `<wbr>`.


There are also tags which are used for changing the appearance of tekst on the screen. For example the Bold <b>, and Italic <i>. 

Some examples in usage:
 <p>This is plain tekst (as we know it) - <b> **and this text is bold** </b> <i> *this tekst is italic* </i> .</p>
 

You can also mix the tags, which doesn't improve readability, but it is nice to know it is a possibility. For that we nest the tags.
<p><b><i>This is very busy text.</i></b></p>

The **`<s>`** element represents strike-through text that is no longer needed, accurate, or correct.

## Syntax

```pseudo
<s>
  <!-- Incorrect, inaccurate, and unneccesary text here -->
</s>
```

The `<s>` element should only contain text content or other elements meant for text content.

> **Note:** The `<s>` element is semantically different from the [`<del>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/del) element because the former is just an edit while the latter conveys an actual update in a document.

## Example

The following is an example of the `<s>` element:

```html
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      <s>worng txet</s>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The rendered output would look like this:

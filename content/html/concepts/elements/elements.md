An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document.

## Syntax

```pseudo
<opening-tag> content </closing-tag>

<self-closing-element />
```

Most elements are made of opening and closing [tags](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/tags) but some are self-closing. Furthermore, some self-closing elements like [`<br>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/br) can have a slash at the end like so: `<br />`.

## Nested Elements

HTML elements can be nested, which means that elements can contain other elements inside them, or nested. All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements: `<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE >
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Blog Post</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

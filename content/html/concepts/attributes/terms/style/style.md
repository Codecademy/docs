The **`style`** attribute specifies how an element will render in a web browser, e.g., the color or size of a font in a paragraph.

When the `style` attribute is used inline, it overrides any styles set globally.

> **Note:** The styling of a page or elements on the page can also be embedded in the `<head>` element using the [`<style>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/style) tag. However, it is more common to style elements through an external [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css) style sheet, which helps keep the code clean and more easily maintained. The syntax for using an external style sheet can be seen in the [`<link>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/link) entry.

## Syntax

```pseudo
<element_tag style="property1:value; property2:value;"></element_tag>
```

Like all global attributes, the `style` attribute supports all HTML tags and can take many properties, e.g., the `style` attribute can be used in the [`<p>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/p), [`<h1>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/h1-h6), or [`<hr>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/hr) tags.

## Example

In the example below, the [`<p>`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/p) element is given a `style` attribute to specify its color, text alignment, and font size:

```html
<p style="color:green; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">
  Here's some text that is being styled using the style attribute.
</p>
```

The example above results in the following output:

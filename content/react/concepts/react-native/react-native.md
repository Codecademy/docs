[**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/) is an [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) mobile development [framework](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework) that works across different operating systems such as iOS and Android. It was released in 2015 by Facebook (now Meta) and can be used on many smart devices, such as phones, personal computers, and TVs, to provide a consistent interface and user experience.

Traditional mobile app development required multiple codebases for each operating system along with their associated programming languages (e.g., [Swift](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swift) for iOS or [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java) or Kotlin for Android). However, React Native provides a single codebase written in [React](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react)-based [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript) and rendered in the device's native language.

## Getting Started

React Native can be installed, configured, and used in two ways:

- The [Expo CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) only requires Node.js to quickly build and troubleshoot an application. This can also be done in-browser with [Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/).
- The [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#installing-dependencies) requires a few extra dependencies and configurations, depending on the scope of the project.

The **`state`** object holds data in a [component](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/components) that is expected to change over time. It is created and maintained by the component itself, and when it changes, the component re-renders.

[Props](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/props) are passed down by parent components, whereas state is created and maintained by the component itself.

Class and functional components handle state differently. Functional components use [hooks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/hooks) to manage state. The following will address how class components manage state.

## Syntax

```pseudo
class ComponentName extends React.Component {
  // With constructor
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      property: value,
    };
  }

  // With property initializer
  state = {
    property: value,
  };

  render() {
    return (
      /* Value of property is rendered */
      <div>{this.state.property}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

The snippet above features two common ways of initializing state in a class component:

- The `constructor()` method assigns a new object to `this.state`.
- A `state` object is directly assigned with property initializers.

Only one of these two ways can be applied when making a class component.

## Example

The following example initializes the `state` object in the component's `constructor()` and returns its value in the `render()` method:

```jsx
class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      brand: 'Chevrolet',
      model: 'Malibu',
      color: 'white',
      year: 1998,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My First Car</h1>
        <p>
          It is a {this.state.color}
          {this.state.brand}
          {this.state.model}
          made in {this.state.year}. ðŸš™
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

With property initializers, it is not necessary to set state or bind methods in the constructor:

```jsx
class Car extends React.Component {
  // No need to use constructor
  state = {
    brand: 'Chevrolet',
    model: 'Malibu',
    color: 'white',
    year: 1998,
  };

  // Same rendered JSX
}
```

It will appear like this:

> **Note:** When the state is updated, the component will automatically re-render. This means that the state should never be updated in a `render()` method because it will cause an infinite loop.

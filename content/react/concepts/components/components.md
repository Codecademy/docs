In React, **components** are pieces of reusable, independent code that make up the user interface (UI) of the application. Each component comes with one or both of the following:

- A [state object](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/state) that contains component data that is expected to change over time.
- A [props object](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/props) with data that can be passed down from parent component to child component.

## Class Components

Class components contain a state and use a `render()` function to return [JSX](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/jsx) markup. When defined, the `class` has to be an extension of the `React.Component` class:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      property1: 'A string',
      property2: 1,
      property3: true,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return <div>...</div>;
  }
}

export default ClassComponent;
```

## Function Components

Function components are stateless and only use the `return` statement. No import statement necessary:

```jsx
function FunctionComponent(props) {
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

## Arrow Function

The [arrow function](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrow-functions) is a feature that was introduced in ES6. It uses the `=` and `>` characters to define a function like a variable. In React, function components can be defined with this syntax:

```jsx
const FunctionComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>...</div>;
};
```

MySQL is an open-source [relational database](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/relational-database) management system developed by MySQL AB and now owned by Oracle Corporation. It uses [SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql) to manage and organize data into related tables, supporting high performance, scalability, and robust security features. It is extensively used in web applications, data warehousing, e-commerce, logging, and content management systems like WordPress. Its flexibility and efficiency make it ideal for both small-scale projects and large-scale, data-intensive applications used by major companies like Facebook and YouTube.

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), or "Rails", is an open-source framework written in [Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby) and used for building web applications. Rails comes with pre-built, boilerplate code that can reused or customized in an application.

While popular with startups in particular, some well-known companies that use Rails include Airbnb, Basecamp, Github, Shopify, and Soundcloud.

## Installation

Rails can be installed as a [Ruby gem](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/gems). However, the following prerequisites must be installed beforehand:

- Ruby version 2.7.0 or later, but preferably the latest version.
- SQLite3 is the default database used on Rails.
- [Node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/node-js) (version 8.16.0 or later) for running [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript) alongside Rails.
- Yarn (version 1 or 2 are both fine) for installing and managing JavaScript packages.

Help with installing these prerequisites can be found [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails).

Lastly, Rails can be installed with the following command:

```bash
gem install rails
```

## The MVC Pattern

Rails uses a common structural pattern known as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It categorizes a web application's code into three interconnected parts:

- The Model that defines the data structure of the application.
- The Views that use templates to represent the visual parts, like the Model data, of the application.
- The Controller that works between the Model and Views to perform business logic for the application.

## Use Cases

Ruby on Rails is used across many industries for building web apps and services. This includes applications like marketing websites, CMSs, eCommerce sites, and custom web applications. The duties for anyone working with Rails may include:

- Creating templates that generate web pages for the front end.
- Writing web services that return JSON for JavaScript-based front-end applications.
- Writing server-side code in Rails and client-side code with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

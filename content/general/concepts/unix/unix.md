**Unix** is a family of operating systems that are all derived from the original AT&T Unix developed at Bell Labs in 1969. Unix is a multitasking, multiuser operating system that is characterized by the implementation of many small modular software tools that can be combined using a scripting language known as the [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell). Unix and Unix-like operating systems are currently used widely on servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

Originally developed for internal use at Bell Labs in the late 1970s, AT&T licensed Unix to a variety of outside parties, leading to a number of academic and commercial Unix variants. These include:

- [Berkeley Software Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution#External_links) from the University of California, Berkeley (now discontinued).
- [SunOS/Solaris](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/) from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle).
- [Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX)](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/power/os/aix) from IBM.

## Timeline

1991 - [Linus Torvalds](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures/linus-torvalds) released the [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux) kernel as a Unix-like free alternative to proprietary Unix systems. It had since exploded into dozens, if not hundreds of different variant distributions.

1992 - A free derivative of BSD Unix was released, leading to the [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/) and [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) projects. Since 1994 BSD Unix has developed several different branches, including [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/).

2000 - Apple released a BSD Unix System named [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29#External_links) that eventually became the core of the macOS operating system.

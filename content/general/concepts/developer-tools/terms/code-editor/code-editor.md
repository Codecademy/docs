A **code editor** is a program designed for writing software in which developers utilize human-readable text to make code easier to parse and understand. They have built-in knowledge of programming languages, allowing different elements of the code (i.e., variables, keywords, functions, etc.) to appear in different colors and improve readability and analysis by developers.

Code editors can compile and run code. In addition to being able to print a code's output, these programs can also identify where and why a particular line of code [fails to execute](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/error).

## Notable Examples

There are numerous code editors available, such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

Which code editor program to use is really up to the individual developer's preferences.

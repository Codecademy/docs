Infrastructure as Code (IaC) frameworks allow organizations to define and manage its computing infrastructure using code rather than manual processes. These frameworks turn configuration files into automated instructions for provisioning, configuring, and managing infrastructure resources such as servers, networks, and storage. This approach helps to eliminate inconsistencies that often arise from manual setup and simplifies the process of scaling environments.

IaC frameworks support version control, meaning that changes to the infrastructure can be tracked over time just like code changes in a software project. This results in improved collaboration among team members and easier rollbacks to previous configurations if issues occur. By automating the provisioning process, IaC decreases the risk of human error, accelerates deployment, and enables CI/CD practices.

Overall, IaC frameworks streamline infrastructure management, ensuring that environments are reproducible, scalable, and aligned with the needs of modern, agile development practices.

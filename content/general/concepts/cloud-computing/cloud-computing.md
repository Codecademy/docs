**Cloud computing** is a method that helps deliver computing services - including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics - over the internet (_the cloud_). It allows users to access resources on-demand without investing in and maintaining physical hardware.

## How Cloud Computing Works

Cloud computing depends on a pay-as-you-go model, where users can scale resources up or down according to their needs. Cloud providers maintain vast data centers worldwide, ensuring high availability, security, and performance. Users can interact with cloud services through a web interface, API, or command-line tools.

## Architecture of Cloud Computing

The cloud computing architecture consists of three main layers:

- **Frontend:** The client-side interface, including browsers, applications, and devices accessing the cloud.
- **Middleware:** The cloud infrastructure that connects front-end devices with backend services.
- **Backend:** The cloud provider's servers, databases, and storage that handle processing and data management.

## Types of Cloud Computing Services

Cloud computing services are classified into three major types:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Gives access to virtualized computing resources like virtual machines, networking, and storage. Examples include AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a development environment with tools and infrastructure, allowing developers to build and deploy applications. Examples include Heroku, Google App Engine.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Helps access software applications over the internet, avoiding the need for local installation. Examples include Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Office 365.

## Use Cases of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is used across various industries for different applications, such as:

- **Web Hosting & Content Delivery:** Websites and applications are hosted on cloud platforms for scalability and availability.
- **Big Data Analytics:** Cloud services handle massive datasets for insights and decision-making.
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Cloud-based ML models and computing power enable AI-driven applications.
- **Remote Work & Collaboration:** Cloud applications like Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams support team collaboration.
- **Disaster Recovery & Backup:** Cloud storage ensures data protection and fast recovery from failures.

Cloud computing continues to transform businesses and IT infrastructure, offering flexibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

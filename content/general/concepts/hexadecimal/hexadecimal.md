**Hexadecimal** (hex, hex numbers, or base-16) is a number system that uses a base of 16 as opposed to the standard decimal system, which is base 10. When representing a number, both number systems share the first ten digits, 0-9. However, for hexadecimal, the remaining digits 10-15 are represented by the letters A-F (not case sensitive)

## Power Of 2

Hexadecimal, as well as binary (base 2) and octal (base 8), have bases that are powers of two, making it easy to convert between one another.

## Syntax

A hexadecimal number is prefixed with `0x` in many computer languages to identify it as a base 16 number.

## Hex Colors

Hex numbers are often used to represent colors (hex colors) and are specified in the following way: `#RRGGBB`(red, green, and blue). One example of a hex color is `#0000FF` which represents the color blue. This is because red and green are set to their lowest value, `00`, and blue is set to its highest value, `FF`.

[**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) is a [cloud computing](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cloud-computing) and app development platform hosted by Google.

It was founded in 2011 as Envovle, a startup which developed [APIs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/api) for embedded chat services in websites. Google acquired Firebase in 2014 and has further developed the services offered by the platform, some of which now include:

- Authentication
- ML Kit
- Realtime Database
- Firebase Hosting
- Performance Monitoring
- Analytics

These services are designed to allow developers to build and maintain apps with many backend services accessed directly by Firebase SDK's.

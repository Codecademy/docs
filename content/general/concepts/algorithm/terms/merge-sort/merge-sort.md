**Merge sort** is a divide-and-conquer sorting [algorithm](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm) that breaks down an [array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/arrays) into smaller arrays, sorts them, and then combines the subarrays back together to return a sorted array.

## MergeSort Method

**Divide:**

- `Base Case`: If the input array `data` has only one element, it's already sorted, so return.
- `Split`: Divide the array into two halves, `left` and `right`, of approximately equal size.

**Conquer**:

- [`Recursive Calls`](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/java-algorithms/modules/recursion-apcs/cheatsheet): Repeatedly call `mergeSort` on each half, `(left)` and `(right)`, to create subarrays so they are sorted independently.

**Combine**:

- `Merge`: Call the `merge` function to merge the two sorted halves (each initially of length 1) `left` and `right`, and combine them back into the original array `data` in a sorted manner.

### Implementation Pt.1

The following example written in [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) shows an implementation of the first part of the Merge Sort Algorithm — splitting the main array into subarrays:

```java
public static void mergeSort(int[] data){
    if(data.length == 1){
        return;
    }
    int n1 = data.length/2;
    int n2 = data.length - n1;
    int[] left, right;
    //make left and right subarrays
    left = new int[n1];
    right = new int[n2];
    System.arraycopy(data, 0, left, 0, n1);
    System.arraycopy(data, n1, right, 0, n2);
    //recursively split left and right arrays
    mergeSort(left);
    mergeSort(right);
    //once array is @ length 1, the left & right array will be merged
    merge(data, left, right);
}
```

### Merge Method

1. **Initialize**:
   - Set indices `l`, `r`, and `k` to 0 to track the positions in `left`, `right`, and `data`.
2. **Compare and Merge**:
   - While both `left` and `right` have elements remaining:
     - Compare the elements at `left[l]` and `right[r]`.
     - Copy the smaller element into `data[k]` and increment the corresponding index (`l` or `r`).
     - Increment `k` to move to the next position in `data`.
3. **Copy Remaining Elements**:
   - If any elements remain in `left`, copy them directly into the remaining positions in `data`.
   - Similarly, if any elements remain in `right`, copy them into the remaining positions in `data`.

### Implementation Pt.2

The following example written in [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) shows an implementation of the second part of Merge Sort — sorting the subarrays and merging them back into the original array:

```java
public static void merge(int[] data, int[] left, int[] right){
    //indexes of arrays left, right, and data
    int l,r,k;
    l = r = k = 0;
    while(l < left.length && r < right.length && k < data.length){
        //find min between left & right element and insert it
        if(left[l] < right[r]){
            data[k] = left[l];
            l++;
        }
        else{
            data[k] = right[r];
            r++;
        }
        //increment index of data after insertion
        k++;
    }
    //if elements still remain in arrays left or right, insert them into the data
    while(l < left.length){
        data[k] = left[l];
        l++;
        k++;
    }
    while(r < right.length){
        data[k] = right[r];
        r++;
        k++;
    }
}

```

### Time Complexity Breakdown

Overall Time Complexity: _O(n log n)_

### Breakdown

1. **Divide**:

   - The `mergeSort` function recursively divides the array into halves until each subarray has only one element.
   - This splitting process has a time complexity of _O(log n)_ due to the repeated halving.

2. **Conquer**:

   - The base case (array of size 1) requires no sorting, so its complexity is _O(1)._

3. **Combine**:
   - The `merge` function merges two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.
   - It iterates through both subarrays once, comparing elements and copying them to the final array.
   - This merging process takes _O(n)_ time, where n is the total number of merged elements.

**Overall Time Complexity:**

- The recursive calls to `mergeSort` create a log n-level tree.
  - The number of levels in this tree directly relates to how many times the array can be divided by 2 before reaching single-element subarrays. This is equivalent to the logarithm of the array's size (log n). For example, an array of 8 elements would have 3 levels (log2 (8) = 3). _Reference the picture below for a visual understanding._

- At each level, the merging step takes O(n) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**, resulting from multiplying the time complexity of each level (n) by the number of levels (log n).

## Benefits of Merge Sort

- `Predictable Efficiency`: Merge sort maintains a time complexity of O(n log n) regardless of the initial arrangement of elements in the input array. This means it performs equally well in best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios.
- `Reliable for Diverse Inputs`: This consistent performance makes merge sort a dependable choice for sorting various input sizes and datasets without unexpected slowdowns due to data arrangement.
- `Efficiency for Large Datasets`: Its O(n log n) time complexity places it among the most efficient sorting algorithms, especially for large datasets, outperforming algorithms like bubble sort and [selection sort](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm/selection-sort) that exhibit worse-case complexities of O(n^2).

**Conditionals** in programming are statements that allow the execution of different blocks of code based on certain criteria. They enable programs to make decisions and perform different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false and help with flow control.

For example, in the United States a citizen must be 18 years old by election day to be eligible to vote. In this case, the condition would be if a given person is 18 or older that determines if they are eligible to vote (assuming they meet all other requirements). Such decision-making can be accomplished programmatically with conditionals.

All programming languages support conditionals in various ways, but there are two main conditionals: `if`-`else` and `switch`.

> **Note:** The following pseudo code blocks are not written in any particular language.

## If-else Statements

The `if` statement is the most basic form of a conditional. It checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.
If the condition is false, the program continues with the next instruction. The basic syntax for an `if` statement is as follows:

```pseudo
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

`else` can proceed an `if` statement, and provides an alternative block of code to execute when the specified condition is false.

```pseudo
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

For example, regarding the eligibility to vote, an `if`-`else` statement can be written out like so:

```pseudo
if (int age >= 18) {
  print("You can vote");
} else {
  print("You can't vote");
}
```

## Switch Statements

The `switch` statement provides a way to perform different actions based on various values of a variable or expression.

It simplifies complex `if`-`else` chains. The basic syntax for a `switch` statement is as follows:

```pseudo
switch (variable/expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if the variable/expression matches value1.
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if the variable/expression matches value2.
    break;
  // More cases...
  default:
    // Required code to be executed if none of the cases match the variable/expression.
    break;
}
```

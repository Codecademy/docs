The **terminal**, also known as the command line or shell, is a powerful tool that enables users to communicate directly with the operating system. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which rely on icons and menus, the terminal uses text-based commands to perform tasks such as file management, software installation, and system administration.

The terminal provides greater control and efficiency, making it a preferred tool for developers, system administrators, and power users. It supports various command-line interpreters, such as Bash (Linux/macOS), Command Prompt (Windows), and PowerShell (Windows). By learning terminal commands, users can automate repetitive tasks, troubleshoot system issues, and navigate files more quickly than through GUI-based interactions.

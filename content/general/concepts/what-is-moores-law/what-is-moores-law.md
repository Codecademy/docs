Moore's Law is a prediction made in 1965 by [Gordon Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore) (the then CEO  of Intel) stating that twice as many transistors would be able to fit onto a computer chip every two years. This idea has served as a guiding principle and goal for the semiconductor industry in order to make sure that progress is being made consistently towards greater computing power in devices. 

Moore's law is more of an economic law than it is one based on physics. There are natural limitations to Moore's Law such as the fact that computer chips can only get so small before reaching the atomic barrier(we can not currently make chips smaller than an atom) which have logically led to the conclusion that though Moore's Law has guided most of the industry for over 50 years, it perhaps will not forever hold true as an accurate description of the state of things technologically, still it has been a concept that has proved to be a great driving force in the world of computing.

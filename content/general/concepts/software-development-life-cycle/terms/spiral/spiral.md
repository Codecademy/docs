The **Spiral model** is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that combines the [Waterfall model](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-development-life-cycle/waterfall) and iterative development approaches. Each phase within this model involve risk analysis and prototyping.

The Spiral model was first introduced by Barry Boehm in 1986 as a result of applying iterative development in constructing softwares. It is divided into four phases:

1. Planning
2. Risk Analysis
3. Engineering
4. Evaluation

Each iteration consists of all above phases but has different aims which are usually:

- Prototype
- Release candidate
- Launch

## Advantages:

- Products are prototyped for quick introduction.
- Errors and failures are identified and handled as they arise.
- Frequent feedback and refinement through cycles.
- Flexible and adaptive to changes.

## Disadvantages:

- Complex workflow and requires expertise especially in risk analysis.
- Costly and time-consuming.

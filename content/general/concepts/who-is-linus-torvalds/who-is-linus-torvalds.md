Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American computer scientist, the creator of the operating system kernel [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), and the distributed revision control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

The Linux kernel is an open source, Unix-inspired operating system kernel publicly released in Version 1.0 by Linus Torvalds in 1994. Today, the Linux operating system manages the hardware and resources of a great number of applications in the Linux distribution, Android, and Chrome OS.

Git was later created by Torvalds in 2005 out of a need for a replacement free distributed system for continued development of the Linux kernel. To support the needs of the Linux kernel team, Torvalds needed a free distribution system that would patch in no more than three seconds, and protect users against accidental or malicious corruption.

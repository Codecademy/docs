Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Webpack can be run on Linux, macOS, Windows operating systems.

As a module bundler, Webpack can be used with **webpack.config.js** to generate dependency graphs, and define rules for tasks performed on a site. Primarily it is used by developers to load, transform, and package modules for in-browser use.

Node.js is required to use webpack, however it is supported by all browsers that are ES5-compliant.

**Frameworks** are tools that provide reusable boilerplate code and functionality for building applications. They are commonly associated with a specific programming language and are suited to different types of tasks.

Using frameworks can save time and reduces the risk of hard-to-find errors. Plus, frameworks have already been tested, so there's less to worry about. Other advantages include:

- Boilerplate code that is clean, secure, and scalable.
- Better tests and debugging methods.
- The ability to customize the code for a specific project.

Unlike libraries, which are pieces of reusable code, frameworks provide supporting structures that the code must follow.

## Types of Frameworks

Frameworks can be used for developing many types of software including the following.

### Web Application Frameworks

These frameworks are used for developing any software for the Web, including websites, web applications, and Web APIs. A few common examples of web frameworks include:

- [Angular](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/angular), an open-source [TypeScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/typescript)-based framework.
- Django, a [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python)-based framework that is fast, secure, and has a great admin interface.
- [Rails](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/ruby-on-rails), a full-stack framework written in [Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby).
- Gatsby, a [React](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react)-based framework used for building static websites like landing pages, portfolios, and blogs.

### Mobile Development Frameworks

These frameworks are used for building applications that can be used on various mobile devices including phones, tablets, and wearables. A few common examples of mobile frameworks include:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is an open-source framework supported on iOS and Android and features customizable widgets.
- [React Native](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/react-native), a framework that is cross-platform and written in [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript).
- [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org/), an JavaScript framework that features robust backend-end support.

An Object is an instance of a class. It is created when we instantiate the class. Object contains the properties and functionalities. When an Object is created memory will be allocated for it.

Creating an Object in Java:

```
class Employee{
  int ssn;
  String name;
  float age;
  public Employee(){}
}

Employee emp1=new Employee();


```

In the above example we created an object for the class **_Employee_**. In Java we create an object using the **new** keyword. The **new** keyword tells the compiler to create a new instance of a class and allocate memory for it.

<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-back-end/" />

The **back-end** of a program or web application serves data to the [front-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/front-end) from sources like a [database](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database).

## Restaurant Analogy

A common analogy for the relationship between the front-end and back-end are customers and employees at a restaurant (representation of the front-end):

- The customer places their order (or "request") with the waiter/waitress (or [server](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server)).
- The order is then taken to the kitchen (representation of the back-end).
- There, the order is prepared (or "processed") with the necessary ingredients (or "data") to produce the expected food item (or "response").
- Finally, the food item is brought back out to the dining area for the customer.

## Common Tasks

Back-end web development can involve a variety of tasks, including:

- Creating, integrating, and managing databases.
- Using back-end [frameworks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework) to build [server-side](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server-side-rendering) software.
- Validating data to make sure it's formatted correctly before being sent to the database.
- Integrating user-facing elements with server-side elements to make sure that information is being sent to the right place so the server can retrieve it.

## Back-End Tools

Back-End Developers use a range of technologies and software, many of which fall into three categories: databases, programming languages, and frameworks.

### Databases

Databases are used to storing important data such as user information. Popular database management systems and [relational databases](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/database/relational-database) include:

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Languages

Back-End Developers normally query their databases with various programming languages such as the following:

- [SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/sql), which is ideal for working in relational databases.
- [Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby) is a beginner-friendly language that has an enthusiastic programming community behind it.
- [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) is a great choice with a concise, human-readable syntax.
- [PHP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php) is an open-source language that is great for server-side scripting.
- [Node.js](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/node-js), which brings back-end work to [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript).
- [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java) is a popular choice still widely used today.

### Frameworks

[Frameworks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework) make all aspects of web development smoother and seamless. This saves developers time they would otherwise spend writing code. Popular frameworks include:

- Sinatra, a lightweight Ruby framework for building web apps.
- [Ruby on Rails](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ruby/ruby-on-rails), a more robust Ruby framework that follows the model-view-controller standard.
- Django, a Python framework that offers dynamic [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html) pages.
- Flask, a lighter Python framework meant for rapid development.
- [Express](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/express), a framework for building back-end APIs with JavaScript.
- Spring, a Java framework that can be used to build back-end APIs.

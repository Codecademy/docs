In C++, the **`.assign()`** method is used with [`vectors`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/vectors) to replace existing elements or add new values. This method can either fill the vector with a specified number of copies of a value or replace the vector's contents with elements from a range, modifying its size if necessary.

> **Note:** To use vectors, including the `vector` library is necessary.

## Syntax

```pseudo
vector.assign(size, value);
```

- `vector`: The instance of the `std::vector` class where the elements will be assigned.
- `count`: The number of elements to assign to the vector.
- `value`: The value to be assigned to each of the `count` elements.

Alternatively, the other syntax is:

```pseudo
vector.assign(first, last);
```

- `first`: The iterator pointing to the beginning of the range to be copied.
- `last`: The iterator pointing just past the end of the range to be copied. This element is excluded from the range.

## Example

In the following example, the `.assign()` method is demonstrated in two distinct ways. First, it fills the vector with a specified number of copies of a given value. Second, it replaces the vector's elements with values from a specified range:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  vector<int> numbers{1, 2, 3};
  vector<int> newNumbers{4, 5, 6, 7};

  // Replacing current elements with 4 copies of the value 8
  numbers.assign(4, 8);
  cout << "After assigning 4 copies of 8: ";
  for (int num : numbers) {
      cout << num << " ";
  }

  cout << endl;

  // Replacing current elements with elements from newNumbers
  numbers.assign(newNumbers.begin(), newNumbers.end());
  cout << "After assigning elements from newNumbers: ";
  for (int num : numbers) {
      cout << num << " ";
  }

  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

The output for the above code is:

```shell
After assigning 4 copies of 8: 8 8 8 8
After assigning elements from newNumbers: 4 5 6 7
```

> **Note:** The `.assign()` method completely replaces the existing contents of the vector, resizing it if necessary. This method is particularly useful for resetting a vector or filling it with specific values or elements from another collection.

The **`.clear()`** method is used to remove all elements from a vector.

## Syntax

```pseudo
vector.clear();
```

The `vector` must be defined using `std::vector` before the `.clear()` method can be used.

## Example

In the example below, `.clear()` method is called on the `numbers` vector:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  // Declaring a vector with 4 integers
  std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};

  // Print out vector size before clear method is called
  std::cout << "Before: " << numbers.size()<<"\n";

  // Call the clear method on numbers vector
  numbers.clear();

  // Print out the size after clear method is called
  std::cout << "After: " << numbers.size()<<"\n";
}
```

The output of the above code is:

```shell
Before: 4
After: 0
```

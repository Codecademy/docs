The **`.lower_bound()`** method in C++ is a member function of the `std::map` and `std::multimap` containers. It is used to find the first element in the map that is not less than a specified key. This method returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is greater than or equal to the given key. If no such element exists, it returns an iterator to the end of the map.

It is important to note that the `std::map` container stores elements in a sorted order based on the keys, and the `.lower_bound()` method utilizes this property to efficiently locate the desired element. This method is particularly useful for tasks such as searching for elements, range queries, and implementing algorithms that require identifying the first element that meets a certain condition. The time complexity of the `.lower_bound()` method is logarithmic, making it efficient for large datasets.

## Syntax

```pseudo
map_name.lower_bound(key& k);
```

**Parameters:**

- `map_name`: The name of the map container on which the operation is performed.
- `k`: The key value to search for. This parameter specifies the key for which the function will find the lower bound.

**Return value:**

- Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the map whose key is greater than or equal to `k`.
- If no element is found (all keys are less than `k`), it returns `map_name.end()`.
- If the map object is const-qualified, the function returns a `const_iterator`; otherwise, it returns an `iterator`.

## Example 1: Finding the First Element Greater Than or Equal to a Key

This example demonstrates how to use the `.lower_bound()` method to find the first element in a map that is greater than or equal to a specified key:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Creating a map with character keys and integer values
  map<char, int> charMap;

  // Inserting elements into the map
  charMap['a'] = 1;
  charMap['b'] = 2;
  charMap['c'] = 3;
  charMap['e'] = 5;

  // Displaying the original map
  cout << "Map contents:" << endl;
  for (auto& pair : charMap) {
    cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << endl;
  }

  // Finding the lower bound for key 'c'
  auto it = charMap.lower_bound('c');

  if (it != charMap.end()) {
    cout << "Lower bound for 'c': " << it->first << " : " << it->second << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "'c' not found in the map." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The output generated by this code is:

```shell
Map contents:
a : 1
b : 2
c : 3
e : 5

Lower bound for 'c': c : 3
```

In this example, the `.lower_bound()` method is used to find the first element in the map that is greater than or equal to the key `'c'`. The iterator `it` points to the element with key `'c'`, and its value is displayed.

If the key `'c'` were not present in the map, the program would indicate that the key was not found.

## Example 2: Finding the Lower Bound for a Non-Existent Key

This example demonstrates how to use `.lower_bound()` to find the lower bound for a non-existent key:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Creating a map with character keys and integer values
  map<char, int> charMap;

  // Inserting elements into the map
  charMap['a'] = 1;
  charMap['b'] = 2;
  charMap['c'] = 3;
  charMap['e'] = 5;

  // Displaying the original map
  cout << "Map contents:" << endl;
  for (auto& pair : charMap) {
    cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << endl;
  }

  // Finding the lower bound for key 'd'
  auto it = charMap.lower_bound('d');

  if (it != charMap.end()) {
    cout << "Lower bound for 'd': " << it->first << " : " << it->second << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "'d' not found in the map." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The output generated by this code is:

```shell
Map contents:
a : 1
b : 2
c : 3
e : 5

'd' not found in the map.
```

In this example, the `.lower_bound()` method is used to find the first element in the map that is greater than or equal to the key `'d'`. Since there is no element with key `'d'`, the program indicates that the key was not found.

## Example 3: Using `.lower_bound()` with a Custom Comparator

This example demonstrates how to use `.lower_bound()` with a custom comparator to find the lower bound for a key in a map with a custom sorting order:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Creating a map with string keys and integer values, sorted in reverse order
  map<string, int, greater<string>> strMap;

  // Inserting elements into the map
  strMap["apple"] = 1;
  strMap["banana"] = 2;
  strMap["cherry"] = 3;
  strMap["date"] = 4;

  // Displaying the original map
  cout << "Map contents:" << endl;
  for (auto& pair : strMap) {
    cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << endl;
  }

  // Finding the lower bound for key "banana"
  auto it = strMap.lower_bound("banana");

  if (it != strMap.end()) {
    cout << "Lower bound for 'banana': " << it->first << " : " << it->second << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "'banana' not found in the map." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The output generated by this code is:

```shell
Map contents:
date : 4
cherry : 3
banana : 2
apple : 1

Lower bound for 'banana': banana : 2
```

The **`.lower_bound()`** method in C++ is a member function of the `std::map` and `std::multimap` containers. It is used to find the first element whose key is _not less than_ a specified key (i.e., greater than or equal to the given key). This method returns an iterator pointing to that element. If no such element exists—meaning all keys are less than the specified key—it returns an iterator to the container's `end()`.

Since `std::map` and `std::multimap` store elements in sorted order based on their keys, `.lower_bound()` efficiently utilizes this ordering to perform fast lookups. It is particularly useful in range queries, binary search-like operations, and algorithms that require locating boundary elements. The time complexity of `.lower_bound()` is **O(log n)** due to the underlying Red-Black Tree structure.

## Syntax

```pseudo
map_name.lower_bound(const Key& k);
```

**Parameters:**

- `map_name`: The name of the `std::map` or `std::multimap` container on which the method is called.
- `k`: A constant reference to the key value. This specifies the key for which the function will find the lower bound.

**Return value:**

- Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the map whose key is greater than or equal to `k`.
- If no element is found (all keys are less than `k`), it returns `map_name.end()`.
- If the map is const-qualified, it returns a `const_iterator`; otherwise, it returns an `iterator`.

## Example 1: Finding the First Element Greater Than or Equal to a Key

This example demonstrates how to use the `.lower_bound()` method to find the first element in a map that is greater than or equal to a specified key:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Creating a map with character keys and integer values
  map<char, int> charMap;

  // Inserting elements into the map
  charMap['a'] = 1;
  charMap['b'] = 2;
  charMap['c'] = 3;
  charMap['e'] = 5;

  // Displaying the original map
  cout << "Map contents:" << endl;
  for (auto& pair : charMap) {
    cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << endl;
  }

  // Finding the lower bound for key 'c'
  auto it = charMap.lower_bound('c');

  if (it != charMap.end()) {
    cout << "Lower bound for 'c': " << it->first << " : " << it->second << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "'c' not found in the map." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The output generated by this code is:

```shell
Map contents:
a : 1
b : 2
c : 3
e : 5

Lower bound for 'c': c : 3
```

In this example, the `.lower_bound()` method is used to find the first element in the map that is greater than or equal to the key `'c'`. The iterator `it` points to the element with key `'c'`, and its value is displayed. If the key `'c'` were not present in the map, the program would indicate that the key was not found.

## Example 2: Finding the Lower Bound for a Non-Existent Key

This example demonstrates how to use `.lower_bound()` to find the lower bound for a non-existent key:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Creating a map with character keys and integer values
  map<char, int> charMap;

  // Inserting elements into the map
  charMap['a'] = 1;
  charMap['b'] = 2;
  charMap['c'] = 3;
  charMap['e'] = 5;

  // Displaying the original map
  cout << "Map contents:" << endl;
  for (auto& pair : charMap) {
    cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << endl;
  }

  // Finding the lower bound for key 'd'
  auto it = charMap.lower_bound('d');

  if (it != charMap.end()) {
    cout << "Lower bound for 'd': " << it->first << " : " << it->second << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "'d' not found in the map." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

The output generated by this code is:

```shell
Map contents:
a : 1
b : 2
c : 3
e : 5
Lower bound for 'd': e : 5
```

In this example, the `.lower_bound()` method is used to find the first element in the map that is greater than or equal to the key `'d'`. Since `'d'` is not present, the method returns an iterator to `'e'`, the first key greater than `'d'`.

## Codebyte Example: Using `.lower_bound()` with a Custom Comparator

This example demonstrates how to use `.lower_bound()` with a custom comparator to find the lower bound for a key in a map with a custom sorting order:

```codebyte/cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Creating a map with string keys and integer values, sorted in reverse order
  map<string, int, greater<string>> strMap;

  // Inserting elements into the map
  strMap["apple"] = 1;
  strMap["banana"] = 2;
  strMap["cherry"] = 3;
  strMap["date"] = 4;

  // Displaying the original map
  cout << "Map contents:" << endl;
  for (auto& pair : strMap) {
    cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << endl;
  }

  // Finding the lower bound for key "banana"
  auto it = strMap.lower_bound("banana");

  if (it != strMap.end()) {
    cout << "Lower bound for 'banana': " << it->first << " : " << it->second << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "'banana' not found in the map." << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

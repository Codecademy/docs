C++ is a very powerful programming language for performance-critical applications that rely on speed and efficient memory management. It’s used in a wide range of industries including software and game development, robotics, microcontrollers, VR/AR, and scientific computing.

It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories in 1979. As the name implies, C++ was derived from the C language; Bjarne’s goal was to add object-oriented programming into C, a language well-respected for its portability and low-level functionality.

**Open-source software (OSS)** is source code that, through licensing, is available for view, modification, and distribution. Although anyone can contribute to OSS, it is usually maintained by a community of volunteer software developers who collaborate on websites like [GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/github).

OSS is also thought to be more trustworthy. Since all the code is publicly available, any unwanted, nefarious behavior or activity will be quickly exposed by the development community maintaining the project.

## Examples

Some examples of OSS software (along with their license and release year) include the following:

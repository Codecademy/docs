[**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org) is an open-source development [framework](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/framework) that brings the best of [React's](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react) client-side functionality to the [server-side](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server-side-rendering) when building web applicatons.

Additionally, Next.js comes with built-in features including the following:

- A page-based [routing](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/routing) system that supports dynamic routes.
- Every page is pre-rendered for improved site performance and search-engine optimization (SEO).
- Any page can either be statically generated ahead of time or rendered on the server-side upon request.
- Faster page loads enables automatic code splitting or "lazy-loading" (load a resource only when it is needed).
- An in-house `Link` component is used for client-side routing with optional pre-fetching.
- There is vast styling support including built-in [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css), Sass, and CSS-in-JS libraries.
- [TypeScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/typescript) is supported in Next.js.

Next.js was originally authored by Guillermo Rauch on [GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/github) in 2016. Due to its functionality, large companies such as Netflix, Starbucks, Uber, GitHub, and Ticketmaster have all used Next.js for their website development. It is currently owned and maintained by the company [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

**Fun Fact:** Codecademy Docs is built with Next.js.

A code editor is a program designed for writing software. Developers writing code using a code editor utilize human-readable text which makes code easier to parse and understand. 

Code editors have built-in knowledge of programming languages, which allow different elements of the code (ie. variables, keywords, functions, etc.) to appear in different colors making the code easier to analyze for developers. Code editors can compile and run code. In addition to being able to print a code's output, these programs can also identify where and why a particular line of code fails to execute.

## Notable Examples

There are numerous code editors available, such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

Which code editor program to use is really up to the individual developer according to their tastes!

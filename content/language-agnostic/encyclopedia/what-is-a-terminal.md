A terminal is a program which allows programmers to type commands directly to the internal CPU or another network device. It is a no-frills program where a user simply inputs text, as opposed to a graphical user interface (GUI) where a user interacts with windows, buttons, and icons.

## Notable Examples

The terminal program has a different name according to the operating system you are using. 

- On MacOS, the command line is known as the **Terminal**.
- On Windows, it is known as **cmd**.
- On Linux, there could be **gnome-terminal**, **konsole**, **xterm**, or another.

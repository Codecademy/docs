The **`string.lower()`** function receives a string and returns a transformed copy with all uppercase letters changed to lowercase, and all other characters unchanged. Uppercase characters are defined by the current locale.

## Syntax

```pseudo
string.lower( s )
```

Where `s` is a string.

Returns a copy of `s` with letters that are uppercase in the current locale converted to lowercase. The string `s` is unmodified.

## Example

The code below demonstrates a basic implementation of the `string.lower()` function.

```lua
stringvar = string.lower("HOw Now Brown CoW?")
print(stringvar)
```

This will result in the following output:

```shell
how now brown cow?
```

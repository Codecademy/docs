In Python, the **`graph_objects`** module in Plotly is used for creating and manipulating complex plots and visualizations. It provides a structured way to build a wide variety of plot types using a declarative syntax. The core components of Plotly's `graph_objects` module are:

1. `Figure`: Represent the entire visualization, including data, layout, and styling.
2. `Traces`: Define individual data sets and their properties (like markers, lines, etc.) within the figure.
3. `Layout`: Control the overall appearance and arrangement of the visualization, including axes, titles, annotations, and more.

## Key Features

- Object-Oriented Approach: Allows for detailed customization and fine-grained control over plot attributes.
- Composability: Different plot types and layout elements can be composed together to create intricate and layered visualizations.
- Interactivity: Plots created with `graph_objects` are interactive, allowing for features such as zooming, panning, and tooltips.
- Integration: Works seamlessly with various data sources and can be integrated into web applications using frameworks like Dash.

## Applications

- Creating 3D trace types like mesh or isosurface.
- Generating subplots of different types and dual-axis plots.
- Faceting plots with multiple different types of traces.

## Syntax

```pseudo
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```

The `go` is an alias commonly used to refer to the `graph_objects` module.

Emphasis can be added by making text bold or italic.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks `**` or underscores `__` before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

```markdown
**bold text**
```

```markdown
**bold text**
```

For example:

```markdown
Please do **NOT** touch your pimples.
```

> Please do **NOT** touch your pimples.

## Italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk `*` or underscore `_` before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

```markdown
_italic text_
```

```markdown
_italic text_
```

For example:

```markdown
This avocado egg sandwich is _very_ good.
```

> This avocado egg sandwich is _very_ good.

## Strikethrough

To make a strikethrough text, use 2 tildes `~` before and after a piece of text.

```markdown
~~Strikethrough text~~
```

For example:

```markdown
I did ~~not~~ build a website.
```

> I did ~~not~~ build a website.

## Emphasis Combinations

Different formatting options can be combined:

```markdown
**This is in bold, _italics_, ~~and strikethrough~~**
```

> **This is in bold, _italics_, ~~and strikethrough~~**

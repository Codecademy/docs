Code blocks can be used to display multiple lines of code. They preserve formatting and provide syntax highlighting when possible.

## Basic Usage

To create a basic code block, wrap the code with three backticks (` ``` `):

````md
```
This is a code block.
```
````

The result will look like this:

```
This is a code block.
```

## Syntax Highlighting

Optionally, a language can be specified for a code block to enable syntax highlighting. This can be done by appending the language to the starting backticks:

````md
```js
console.log('Hello world');
```
````

The result will look like this:

```js
console.log('Hello world');
```

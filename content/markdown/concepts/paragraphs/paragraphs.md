A paragraph is a block of text with one or more blank lines between them.

## Syntax

```md
Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.

Lo. Lee. Ta.
```

This would output:

Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.

Lo. Lee. Ta.

## Line Breaks

Double line breaks separate text with a blank line and can be created by pressing the enter key twice at the end of a line. A single line breaks separate text by starting a new line directly below the previous and can be created by adding a `\` symbol or two spaces at the end of a line and then pressing the enter key.

```md
Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving.

They make mistakes, but they donâ€™t quit.
```

```md
This is a\
single line break
```

## Best Practices

Make sure to not add tabs or spaces in front of the paragraph text, because they will create unwanted indentation.

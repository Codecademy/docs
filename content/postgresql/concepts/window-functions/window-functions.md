**`Window functions`** in PostgreSQL provide an amazing feature that enables computing calculations across sets of rows related to the current row in query. These functions empower you to define rows to operate on based on specific criteria, such as a specific range or grouping.

Window functions are defined using an `OVER` clause that specifies how to partition and order rows for the function to operate on, this clause is what makes the window function different from the normal aggregate function.

## Syntax

In a simple syntax, a window function can be performed over a given column, as seen below:

```pseudo
SELECT employee_id, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY employee_id) AS row_num FROM employees;`
```

This query uses the `employee_id` to calculate a unique row number for each employee, `ORDER BY` within `OVER` controls the order in which rows are processed by the window function. The generated row number is assigned the column name `row_num` by the `AS row_num` part of the syntax.

Below is a table of window functions in PostgreSQL:

| Function       | Syntax                                                                                                                                           | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rank()         | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name DESC) FROM table_name;`             | Returns the ranking of the current row.                                                         |
| Row_number()   | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name DESC) FROM table_name;`       | Returns the number of the current row within its partition, counting from 1.                    |
| Dense_rank()   | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, dense_rank() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name DESC) FROM table_name;`       | Returns the rank of the current row, this function effectively counts groups.                   |
| Ntile()        | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, ntile (Argument) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name DESC) FROM table_name;`   | Returns an integer ranging from 1 to the argument value.                                        |
| Cume_dist()    | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, cume_dist() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name ASC) FROM table_name;`         | Returns the cumulative distribution.                                                            |
| Percent_rank() | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, percent_rank() OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name ASC) FROM table_name;`      | Returns the relative rank of the current row, that is the total partition rows - 1.             |
| First_Value()  | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, first_value (value) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name ASC) FROM table_name;` | Returns the -value- of the first row in a window frame defined by partition and order criteria. |
| Last_value()   | `SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN, last_value (value) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name ASC) FROM table_name;`  | Returns the -value- of the last row in a window frame.                                          |

## Example

To understand the `Rank()` and `Row_number()` functions, let's consider the following `staff` table as an example to demonstrate how these window functions work:

| `id` | `employee` | `address` | `contact` | `salary` |
| ---- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| 01   | John       | Tokyo     | +81       | 5500     |
| 02   | Kate       | Beijing   | +186      | 5000     |
| 03   | Tad        | Mumbai    | +91       | 2500     |
| 04   | Martha     | Tokyo     | +727      | 3500     |
| 05   | Will       | Paris     | +33       | 4000     |
| 06   | Ruth       | Dubai     | +971      | 2500     |
| 07   | Kaka       | Mumbai    | +213      | 4500     |
| 08   | Tolf       | Tokyo     | +44       | 2000     |

From the above `_staff_ table`, to rank the employees using the `Rank()` function, we select the `id`, `salary`, and `address` columns from the `_staff_` table, and then use the `RANK()` window function to assign a rank to each row based on the `_salary_` column within each partition defined by the `_address_` column.

```sql
SELECT id, salary, address, Rank() OVER (PARTITION BY address ORDER BY salary DESC) FROM staff;`
```

Breaking down the syntax:

- The clause `SELECT`, selects the id, salary, and address columns from the staff table.
- The `Rank() OVER` part computes the row number of each row.
- The `(PARTITION BY address ORDER BY salary DESC)` clause actively defines how the window function partitions the data.
- The statement ends with `FROM staff`, signifying that it operates on the `_staff _` table.

This is the output of the above query:

| `id` | `salary` | `address` | `rank` |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| 01   | 5500     | Tokyo     | 1      |
| 04   | 3500     | Tokyo     | 2      |
| 08   | 2000     | Tokyo     | 3      |
| 07   | 4500     | Mumbai    | 1      |
| 03   | 2500     | Mumbai    | 2      |
| 02   | 5000     | Beijing   | 1      |
| 05   | 4000     | Paris     | 1      |
| 06   | 2500     | Dubai     | 1      |

In PostgreSQL, the `row_number` window function plays a useful role by defining the row number of a column. Let's use the `_staff_ table` to assign a row number to each row based on the `salary` column, within each group of rows that have the same `address`, ordering the rows by `salary` in descending order within each group.

```sql
SELECT id, salary, address, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY address ORDER BY salary DESC) FROM staff`
```

Breaking down the syntax:

- The clause `SELECT`, selects the `id`, `salary`, and `address` columns from the `_staff_` table.
- The `Row_number() OVER` part computes the row number of each row.
- The `(PARTITION BY address ORDER BY salary DESC)` clause actively defines how the window function partitions the data.
- `PARTITION BY address` partitions the rows into groups based on values in the `address` column.
- `ORDER BY salary DESC` allows the rows to be ordered by `salary` in descending order within each partition.
- The statement ends with `FROM staff`, signifying that it operates on the `_staff_` table.

This is the output of the above query:

| `id` | `salary` | `address` | `row_number` |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 01   | 5500     | Tokyo     | 1            |
| 04   | 3500     | Tokyo     | 2            |
| 08   | 2000     | Tokyo     | 3            |
| 07   | 4500     | Mumbai    | 1            |
| 03   | 2500     | Mumbai    | 2            |
| 02   | 5000     | Beijing   | 1            |
| 05   | 4000     | Paris     | 1            |
| 06   | 2500     | Dubai     | 1            |

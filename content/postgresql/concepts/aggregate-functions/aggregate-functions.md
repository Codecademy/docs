In PostgreSQL, **aggregate functions** perform calculations on a data set and return a single result. These functions use the `SELECT` statement and the `GROUP BY` clause to execute operations such as counting, adding, finding the average, and searching the maximum or minimum value(s).

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to arrange identical data into groups. In other words, this clause summarizes data by grouping rows that have the same values in the specified columns.

Additionally, the `HAVING` clause can be used with `GROUP BY` to further filter groups based on specific conditions applied to the aggregated data.

PostgreSQL offers the following aggregate functions:

- `MAX()`: Computes the maximum among all the input values.
- `MIN()`: Computes the minimum among all the input values.
- `SUM()`: Computes the sum of all the input values.
- `COUNT()`: Computes the number of input rows.
- `AVG()`: Computes the average of all the input values.

## Syntax

Here is a `sales` table to be used as an example to understand how the above aggregate functions work:

| Transaction_ID | Customer | Product     | Quantity | Cost   |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| 041            | Varrick  | Iphone Xr   | 2        | 88000  |
| 021            | Tolf     | Samsung S8  | 2        | 75000  |
| 033            | Kuvira   | Airpods     | 3        | 4000   |
| 001            | Kalu     | Iphone X    | 1        | 44000  |
| 456            | Isujah   | HP Laptop   | 1        | 65000  |
| 026            | Zion     | MacBook Air | 3        | 250000 |

Using this table, all the aggregate functions mentioned above are explained below.

### MAX()

```sql
SELECT MAX(Quantity * Cost) AS Max_Spent FROM sales;
```

This query calculates the maximum amount spent on a single commodity in the `sales` table by multiplying the `Quantity` column with the `Cost` column. Then, it determines the maximum among all the calculated values.

### MIN()

```sql
SELECT MIN(Quantity * Cost) AS Min_Spent FROM sales;
```

This query calculates the minimum amount spent on a single commodity in the `sales` table by multiplying the `Quantity` column with the `Cost` column. Then, it determines the minimum among all the calculated values.

### SUM()

```sql
SELECT SUM(Quantity * Cost) AS Total_Spent FROM sales;
```

This query calculates the total amount spent on all the sales in the `sales` table by multiplying the `Quantity` column with the `Cost` column for each sale. Then, it sums all the calculated values.

### COUNT()

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales;
```

This query returns the total number of records in the `sales` table.

### AVG()

```sql
SELECT AVG(Quantity * Cost) AS Average_Spent FROM sales;
```

This query finds the average amount spent per sale in the `sales` table by calculating the product of the `Quantity` and `Cost` columns for each sale. Then, it finds the average of all the calculated values.

## Examples

Here is an example that demonstrates the usage of aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT Customer, SUM(Quantity * Cost) AS Total_Spent
FROM sales
GROUP BY Customer;
```

This query calculates the total amount spent by each customer and groups the results by the `Customer` column.

This is the output of the above query:

| Customer | Total_Spent |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Varrick  | 176000      |
| Tolf     | 150         |
| Kuvira   | 8000        |
| Kalu     | 88000       |
| Isujah   | 130000      |
| Zion     | 750000      |

Here is another example that shows the use of aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT Customer, SUM(Quantity * Cost) AS Total_Spent
FROM sales
GROUP BY Customer
HAVING SUM(Quantity * Cost) > 140000;
```

This query filters the results by showing only those customers who spent over 1,40,000.

This is the output of the above query:

| Customer | Total_Spent |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Varrick  | 176000      |
| Zion     | 750000      |

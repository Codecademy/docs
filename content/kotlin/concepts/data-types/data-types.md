**Data types** classify values in Kotlin and determine the operations that can be performed on them.

Unlike some languages, Kotlin does not have primitive data types. All data types in Kotlin are objects. However, for performance reasons, the Kotlin compiler may internally optimize certain types using JVM primitives.

## Primitive Data Types

There are the following different types of primitive data types in Kotlin:

- Boolean
- Byte
- Char
- Double
- Float
- Int
- Long
- Short

### Boolean

In Kotlin, `Boolean` can hold either `true` or `false`. To declare a boolean variable, the `var` or `val` keyword can be used, followed by the variable name, and the assigned boolean value:

```kotlin
val isTrue: Boolean = true
val isFalse: Boolean = false
```

A boolean can be used to determine the outcome of `if...else` statements:

```kotlin
fun main(){
  val condition: Boolean = true

  if (condition) {
    // Code that gets executed if the variable is true
  } else {
    // Code that gets executed if the variable is false
  }
}
```

### Byte

A `Byte` is a data type that is similar to an integer data type, but it is only 8 bits in size. While an integer can be a different size depending on the system, a byte can only hold values from -128 to 127.

Bytes are commonly used to store small pieces of data, such as characters in a text file or colors in an image.

Here is an example of how to declare a byte variable in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val a: Byte = 50
  val b: Byte = 25
  val c: Byte = a + b as Byte

  print(c)
}
```

The output will be:

```shell
75
```

Calculations that exceed the byte range will produce unexpected results:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val a: Byte = 120
  val b: Byte = 120
  val c: Byte = a + b as Byte

  print(c)
}
```

The expected output is `240`, but since that exceeds the range for a byte, the output will be:

```shell
-88
```

### Char

`Char` represents a primitive data type that can hold any character from the Unicode character set, which includes letters, digits, symbols, and special characters.

Here is an example of how to declare a character variable in Kotlin:

```kotlin
val ch: Char = 'A'
```

### Double

`Double` represents a 64-bit floating-point number. It is a primitive data type that can hold values with a fractional component, such as 3.14 or 0.5.

Here is an example of how to declare a double variable in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val a: Double = 3.14
  val b: Double = 2.71
  val c: Double = a * b as Double

  print(c)
}
```

The output of the above code will be:

```shell
8.5094
```

In this example, `c` will be assigned the value 8.5014, which is the result of 3.14 \* 2.71.

A double can be used to perform more advanced operations, such as calculating the square root of a number or raising a number to the power of another number. For example:

```kotlin
import kotlin.math.sqrt
import kotlin.math.pow

fun main() {
  val a: Double = 16.0
  val b: Double = sqrt(a)
  val c: Double = a.pow(2)

  println("The square root of $a is $b.")
  println("$a raised to the power of 2 is $c.")
}
```

The output will be:

```shell
The square root of 16.0 is 4.0.
16.0 raised to the power of 2 is 256.0.
```

### Float

`Float` represents a 32-bit floating-point number. It is a primitive data type that can hold values with a fractional component, such as 3.14 or 0.5.

Here is an example of how to declare a float in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val a: Float = 3.14f
  val b: Float = 2.71f
  val c: Float = a * b as Float

  print(c)
}
```

The output will be:

```shell
8.5094
```

In this example, `c` will be assigned the value 8.5014, which is the result of 3.14 \* 2.71.

### Int

`Int` represents a 32-bit signed integer. It is a primitive data type that can hold values ranging from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

Here is an example of how to declare an integer variable in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val a: Int = 50
  val b: Int = 25
  val c: Int = a + b

  print(c)
}
```

The output of the above code will be:

```shell
75
```

### Long

`Long` represents a 64-bit signed integer. It is a primitive data type that can hold values ranging from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.

Here is an example of how to declare a long variable in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val a: Long = 500000000
  val b: Long = 250000000
  val c: Long = a + b

  print(c)
}
```

The output for the above code will be:

```shell
750000000
```

In this example, `c` will be assigned the value 750000000, which is the result of 500000000 + 250000000.

### Short

`Short` represents a 16-bit signed integer. It is a primitive data type that can hold values ranging from -32768 to 32767.

Here is an example of how to declare a short variable in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val a: Short = 50
  val b: Short = 25
  val c: Short = (a + b).toShort()

  print(c)
}
```

The output for the above code will be:

```shell
75
```

In this example, the `c` variable will be assigned the value 75, which is the result of 50 + 25. The `toShort()` function is used to convert the result to a `Short` type.

## Non-Primitive Data Types

The following are non-primitive data types in Kotlin:

- Any
- Arrays
- Class
- Enum
- List
- Map
- Nothing
- Set
- String
- Unit

### Arrays

An `Array` is a data structure that stores a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type. They are non-primitive data types, which means they are derived from primitive data types or other non-primitive data types.

To declare an array in Kotlin, the `arrayOf()` function can be utilized, with the elements of the array specified within the parentheses. For instance:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val numbers: Array<Int> = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
}
```

In this example, the `numbers` variable is an array of integers that contains some numerical values. The type of the array is specified using the `Array<Int>` syntax, which indicates that the array contains elements of the `Int` type.

### String

In Kotlin, a `String` is a data type that represents a sequence of characters. A string can be used to store and manipulate text in a program.

Here is an example of how to declare and initialize a string in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val message: String = "Hello, World!"
  print(message)
}
```

The output for the above code will be:

```shell
Hello, World!
```

Strings are also [immutable](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-immutability.html) in Kotlin.

The `+` operator can be used to concatenate strings or the `trim()` function to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string. For example:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val greeting: String = "Hello, "
  val name: String = "John"
  val fullMessage: String = greeting + name
  println(fullMessage.trim())
}
```

The output for the above code will be:

```shell
Hello, John
```

### Any

In Kotlin, the `Any` type is a supertype of all types in the language. It represents a general type that can hold any value.

Here is an example of how to declare a variable of type `Any` in Kotlin:

```kotlin
fun main() {
  val value: Any = 100
  val value2: Any = "Hello, World!"
  println(value)
  println(value2)
}
```

The output for the above code will be:

```shell
100
Hello, World!
```

### Nothing

`Nothing` is a special type that represents the absence of a value. It is a subtype of all types in the language and cannot be instantiated.

The `Nothing` type is used to indicate that a function never returns a value. For example, a function that throws an exception or terminates the program will have a return type of `Nothing`.

Here is an example of a function that has a return type of `Nothing`:

```kotlin
fun error(): Nothing {
  throw IllegalStateException("An error occurred.")
}
```

In the above, the `error()` function throws an exception and does not return a value, therefore, its return type is `Nothing`.

### Unit

In Kotlin, `Unit` is another special type that represents the absence of a value. It's similar to [`Void`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/data-types/void) in other programming languages and is used to indicate that a function does not return a value. `Unit` is also a subtype of `Any` which means that it can be used in place of any type.

The `Unit` type can be used to specify that a function has a return type of `Unit` when it is not possible to infer the return type from the function's body. For example:

```kotlin
fun doSomething(): Unit {
  // Perform some action here
}
```

In the above example, the `doSomething()` function performs some action and does not return a value. Therefore, its return type is `Unit`.

[**Kotlin**](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/kotlin) is a programming language used for general purposes including [front-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/front-end), [back-end](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/back-end), and mobile development. Since Kotlin is fully compatible with [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java), its syntax may seem familiar to those with proficiency in Java.

After being released by JetBrains in 2011, Kotlin became the preferred language for Android development by Google in 2019.

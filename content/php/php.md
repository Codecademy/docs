**PHP** (a recursive acronym for "PHP Hypertext Preprocessor") is a popular [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) scripting language widely used as a [server-side](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server-side-rendering) tool for creating dynamic web pages.

A big part of PHP's value is its use as a dynamic scripting language that works hand-in-hand with [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html).

A PHP interpreter makes a website dynamic and customizable, allowing a site to respond to user input or information in some expected way. The interpreter is a key link between the user and web server, databases, and the relevant files or responses sent back to that user.

## PHP in Action

[ScienceSoft](https://www.scnsoft.com/) a Dallas-based IT consulting and software development provider, offers examples of how they've used PHP scripting for clients' projects:

- Shopping for audio equipment with a playlist of test tracks, the ability to tell the stand's app what model a customer wants, and the production of graphs comparing models for a customer.
- Booking movie theater tickets with a mobile app that has seat plans, notifications, and in-depth movie information.

[Symfony](https://symfony.com/at-a-glance) is a French PHP framework provider that works on PHP-based projects for organizations of all kinds. This includes [the 2016 campaign site](https://symfony.com/blog/an-open-source-web-platform-for-the-new-president-of-france) of French President Emmanuel Macron.

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is another PHP framework used for developing web applications. It is known for its elegant syntax, modular structure, and built-in features that make it easier to develop high-quality web applications. Many leading companies use Laravel to develop their web applications including [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/).

Lastly, [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/) is also an open-source framework that has been used by various companies, including:

- Internet Marketing Ninjas, who used PHP to build its marketing and management tools and a central hub for users.
- Printivo.com, a Nigerian customized printing company, who used PHP for their customer-facing website and internal order management systems.

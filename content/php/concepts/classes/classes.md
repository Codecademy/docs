A class is a definition of the properties and methods of a particular type of object.
When a class is used to define a new object, the resultant object is referred to as an instance of that class.

In a PHP class definition, properties are variables, methods are functions.

## Syntax

```php
<?php
class Car {
  // Properties
  public $make;
  public $model;
  public $year;

  // Methods
  function set_year($year) {
    $this->year = $year;
  }
  function get_year() {
    return $this->year;
  }
}
?>
```

This defines the class `Car` which has the properties `make`, `model` and `year`, and the methods `set_year()` and `get_year()`.

## The `$this` Keyword

Inside methods of a class, the `$this` keyword can be used to return a reference to the object instance that's executing the method. An example of this is shown above.
When the method refers to `$this->year`, it is referring to the `year` property of the particular object instance that is executing the method.

## The `new` Keyword

An object is created from a class definition by using the `new` keyword.

### Example

```php
<?php
  class Car {
    // Properties
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;

    // Methods
    function set_year($year) {
      $this->year = $year;
    }
    function get_year() {
      return $this->year;
    }
  }

  // Create object instances
  $honda = new Car();
  $ford = new Car();

  // Use class properties
  $honda->make = 'Honda';
  $honda->model = 'Accord';
  $ford->make = 'Ford';
  $ford->model = 'Explorer';

  // Use class methods
  $honda->set_year(2019);
  $ford->set_year(2020);

  echo $honda->get_year() . ' ' . $honda->make . ' ' . $honda->model . '<br/>';
  // Output: 2019 Honda Accord

  echo $ford->get_year() . ' ' . $ford->make . ' ' . $ford->model . '<br/>';
  // Output: 2020 Ford Explorer

?>
```

## The `instanceof` Operator

The `instanceof` operator returns `true` when the operand on the left belongs to the class in the right operand.

### Example

```php
<?php
  $ford = new Car;
  if ($ford instanceof Car) {
    echo 'It is a Car!'; } else {
    echo 'It is not a Car!'; }
  // Output: It is a Car!
?>
```

## Codebyte Example

The following code defines a `Library` class with attributes for library details, methods to display library information and register books with associated data. Try executing it:

```codebyte/PHP
<?php
class Library
{
  private $libraryName;
  private $ranking;
  private $country;

  // The constructor to initialize the class
  public function __construct(string $libraryName, int $ranking, string $country)
  {
    $this->libraryName = $libraryName;
    $this->ranking = $ranking;
    $this->country = $country;
  }

  // Method to get information about the library
  public function getInfoLibrary()
  {
    $info = $this->libraryName . ' is the number ' . $this->ranking . ' in the world ranking. Located in ' . $this->country . '.<br><br>';
    echo $info;
  }

  // Method to register a new book
  public function registerBook(string $author, string $bookTitle, int $publishYear)
  {
    $portfolio = [
      'author' => $author,
      'bookTitle' => $bookTitle,
      'publishYear' => $publishYear
    ];

    print_r($portfolio); // print array for debugging or return $portfolio for further use
  }
}

// Create a new Library instance and call methods
$libraryOne = new Library('The British Library', 1, 'United Kingdom');
$libraryOne->getInfoLibrary();
$libraryOne->registerBook('J.R.R. Tolkien', 'The Silmarillion', 1977);
?>
```

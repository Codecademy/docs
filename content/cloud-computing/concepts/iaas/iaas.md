**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** is a cloud computing model that offers remote computer, storage, and networking resources that are available on demand. These services are typically offered on a pay-as-you-go basis. The user is given control of [virtual machines](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/virtual-machines) (software running on a cloud server that acts as its own independent computer). These virtual machines are managed by another piece of software running on the cloud server, known as a hypervisor. Examples of this type of software include Oracle VirtualBox or VMware ESXi. The user is allowed to run arbitrary software on these virtual machines, including operating systems.

IaaS provides an [API](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/api) to control the low-level details of the underlying network infrastructure (e.g., backups, partitioning, security, and physical resources). While they do not have direct access to the infrastructure, users can configure:

- Operating systems
- Storage
- Deployed applications
- Networking components (e.g., host firewalls)

The user's responsibilities include the following:

- Maintaining the virtual machines.
  - This includes keeping operating systems and applications patched and up-to-date.
- Paying the cloud service only for the number of resources allocated and consumed.

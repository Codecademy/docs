The 🔁 statement repeats a code block while as long as the given condition is 👍 (true). And if the condition is never 👍 (false), the code block will be ignored and skipped.

Due to the ease of use of the 🔂 (for-in) statement, 🔁 is only used seldomly.

## Infinite Loop

```emojic
🏁 🍇
  🔁 👍 🍇
    😀 🔤It goes on and on and on🔤❗️
  🍉
🍉
```

This program will infinitely print “It goes on and on and on”.

```shell
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
...
```

A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It can be used to provide additional information to aid in understanding the code.

There are two types of comments in Emojicode.

## Single-line Comments

In Emojicode, single-line comments are made with `💭`. Any text after the `💭` that is on the same line is not executed.

```shell
💭 The next line outputs "Hello"
😀 🔤Hello🔤❗️
```

## Multiline Comments

Multiline comments are created with `💭🔜` and `🔚💭`. Any text in between is not executed.

```shell
💭🔜
This is a comment.
It will be ignored by the compiler.
🔚💭
```

## Example

Here's a whole Emojicode program with comments:

```shell
💭🔜
Emojicode is created by:
Theo Weidmann
🔚💭

🏁 🍇
  😀 🔤Hello World!🔤❗️
  💭 Output: Hello World!
🍉
```

A comment is a piece of text within a program that is not executed. It can be used to provide additional information to aid in understanding the code.

There are two types of comments in Emojicode.

## Single-line Comments

In Emojicode, single-line comments are made with `💭`. Any text after the `💭` that is on the same line is not executed.

```bash
💭 The next line outputs "Hello"
😀 🔤Hello🔤❗️
```
 
## Multiline Comments

Multiline comments are created with `💭🔜` and `🔚💭`. Any text in between is not executed.

```bash
💭🔜
This is a comment.
It will be ignored by the compiler.
🔚💭
```

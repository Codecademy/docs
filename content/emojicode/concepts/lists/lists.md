A *list* literal is a listing of expressions. 

Lists are always ordered and can contain different types of objects, such as strings, integers, booleans, etc. Lists are a mutable data type and therefore a good choice for dynamic data (adding and subtracting to lists).

## Syntax

For instance, the example below is a literal with the values `14`, `67`, `2434`.

```emojic
🍿 14 67 2434 🍆
```

Here's another list with three strings:

```emojic
🍿 🔤eggs🔤 🔤blueberries🔤 🔤cookies🔤 🍆
```

The compiler will try to infer the type of a list literal. The default type of list literals, is the list type 🍨, an ordered mutable collections of values.

**Sklearn**, alternatively known as **Scikit-learn**, is a free, [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) machine learning library for [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python). It includes a wide range of [algorithms](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/algorithm) for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning helps with tasks like classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data for tasks like clustering (grouping similar data points). This library is popular for its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with other popular Python libraries like [NumPy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy), SciPy, and [Pandas](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/pandas).

## Installation

The latest version of Sklearn can be installed using [`pip`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/pip):

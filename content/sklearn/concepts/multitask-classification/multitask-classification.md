In Sklearn, **multitask classification** is a machine learning technique where a single model is trained to predict multiple related outputs (tasks) for each input data point. Instead of building separate models for each task, the model is designed to handle all tasks simultaneously. This approach allows the model to learn from the shared information between tasks, potentially leading to better performance.

## Example

Performing multitask classification with Sklearn involves using a classifier that can handle multiple outputs. Though Sklearn doesn't have a specific class called `MultiTaskClassifier` in this case like it does for regression (i.e., `MultiTaskLasso`), classifiers that support multiple outputs can be used. A common example is the `RandomForestClassifier` or `GradientBoostingClassifier` with the `multioutput` parameter.

In case of a real-world example, suppose there's a manufacturing company that produces various types of electronics. The company is interested in predicting two key aspects for each product:

- _Product Quality (High, Medium, Low)_: This represents how good the product is, based on factors like durability, functionality, and customer satisfaction.
- _Market Demand (High, Medium, Low)_: This indicates how well the product is expected to be sold in the market.

The company wants to use a machine learning model to predict these two aspects simultaneously for each product based on several features like production cost, material quality, manufacturing time, and more.

To achieve this, a `RandomForestClassifier` can be used, which predicts both the product quality and market demand at the same time.

Hereâ€™s how the model can be set up:

```py
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_multilabel_classification

# Generate example data for multitask classification
X, y = make_multilabel_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=10, n_classes=2, n_labels=1, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)

# New product data to predict
new_product = [[0.6, 1.5, -0.2, 0.9, 2.0, -1.1, 1.3, 0.6, 1.2, -0.8]]

# Predict the quality and demand for the new product
predictions = model.predict(new_product)

print("Predicted labels (Quality, Demand):", predictions)
```

The parameters used in the above example are as follows:

- `n_samples`: The number of samples in the dataset.
- `n_features`: The number of features in each sample.
- `n_classes`: The number of classes (tasks) to predict. In this case, there are 2 classes (quality and demand) to predict.
- `n_labels`: The average number of labels per sample.

The output will be an array containing two predicted labels, like:

```shell
Predicted labels (Quality, Demand): [[0 1]]
```

In the above output, `0` indicates _low quality_ and `1` indicates _high demand_.

## Codebyte Example

The following codebyte example trains a Random Forest classifier for multilabel classification on synthetic data and
predicts the quality and demand for a new product.

```codebyte/python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_multilabel_classification

# Generate example data for multitask classification
X, y = make_multilabel_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=10, n_classes=2, n_labels=1, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)

# New product data to predict
new_product = [[0.6, 1.5, -0.2, 0.9, 2.0, -1.1, 1.3, 0.6, 1.2, -0.8]]

# Predict the quality and demand for the new product
predictions = model.predict(new_product)

print("Predicted labels (Quality, Demand):", predictions)
```

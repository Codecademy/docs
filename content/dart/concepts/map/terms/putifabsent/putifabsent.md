The **`.putifabsent()`** method in Dart is used to insert a key-value pair into a map if the key is not already present. If the key is already present, it does nothing and returns the existing value associated with the key.

## Syntax

```pseudo
V putIfAbsent(K key, V ifAbsent())
```

- `key`: The key to check for or add to the map.
- `ifAbsent`: A function that returns the value associated with the key if it is not already in the map.

## Example

In this example, the key `key3` is not present in the map, so the `ifAbsent()` function `() => 3` is invoked to provide the value 3. The keys `key1` and `key2` are present so the `ifAbsent()` function is not invoked and the existing values are returned.

```dart
void main() {
  var map = {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2};
  // 'key3' is not present, so the value 3 will be provided by the ifAbsent function
  map.putIfAbsent('key3', () => 3); // {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3}
  // 'key1' is present, so the ifAbsent function is not invoked
  print(map.putIfAbsent('key1', () => 5)); // Notice the output is the existing value associated with key1
  print(map); // output {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3}
}
```

Here is the output for the above code:

```shell
1
{key1: 1, key2: 2, key3: 3}
```

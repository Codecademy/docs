In Dart, the **`.elementAt()`** method is used to access the element at a specific index in a list. The index needs to be a non-negative integer that's smaller than the length of the list.

## Syntax

```pseudo
list.elementAt(index);
```

- `list`: The list that needs to be searched.
- `index`: The index that needs to be accessed.

## Example

Here is an example that demonstrates the use of the `.elementAt()` method:

```dart
void main() {
  List nums = ['11', '22', '33', '44', '55'];
  // Using the .elementAt() method to access the element at nums[2]
  var num = nums.elementAt(2);
  print('The element at nums[2] is: ${num}');
}
```

The output for the above example is:

```shell
The element at nums[2] is: 33
```

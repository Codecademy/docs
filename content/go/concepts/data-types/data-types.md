Data types are the classifications given to the different kinds of values used in everyday programming. In Go, there are seven fundamental data types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Arrays, Structs, Slices, and Pointers.

## Numbers

In Go, any number is regarded as number, but there are three sub-categories:

- Integers (signed and unsigned)
- Floating-point numbers
- Complex numbers

### Integers

Integers are number-types that are either:

- Signed (`int`) integers that can be positive or negative.
- Unsigned (`uint`) integers ranging from 0 to positive infinity.

Each integer value comes in 4 different memory sizes.

- 8-bit: `int8`/`uint8`
- 16-bit: `int16`/`uint16`
- 32-bit: `int32`/`uint32`
- 64-bit: `int64`/`uint64`
- 32- or 64-bit based on system architecture: `int`/`uint`
- Synonym for int32: `rune`
- synonym for int8: `byte`

### Floating-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers can contain a decimal point. There are two different sizes.

- 32-bit: `float32`
- 64-bit: `float64`

### Complex Numbers

Complex numbers are composed of a real number and an imaginary number. The real number is either a float. There are two different sizes:

- 32-bit float + imaginary number: `complex64`
- 64-bit float + imaginary number: `complex128`

```golang
// Initialize with complex() taking 2 arguments: a float and a complex number
var complex complex64 = complex(1, 2) // Equals 1 + 2i
```

Variables can also be initialized with a shorthand:

```golang
complex := 1 + 2i
```

## Strings

A string represents a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable; once they are created they can't be modified.

```golang
var s string

s = "Hello, World!"
```

## Booleans

A boolean can hold one of two possible values, either `true` or `false`.

```golang
var isValid bool

isValid = true
isValid = false
```

## Arrays

Arrays are list with static capacity. They can't change their capacity after the declaration.

```golang
// Declare and initialize an array of capacity 5 and fill it with elements
someArray := [5]int{0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## Slices

Slices can change their capacity dynamically even after their declaration. Under the hood a slice references an array. If the array changes, so does the slice.

```golang
// Copy the elements from index 0 until (excluding) index 3 into a slice
var slice []int = someArary[0:3]
```

## Structs

In Go, a struct is a more complex type that can contain custom fields. It's similar to an [object in JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/objects) or a [dictionary in Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dictionaries). The fields of a struct can be accessed with a dot `.`.

```golang
// Declaration with "type ... struct" keywords
type Box struct {
  X int
  Y int
 }
```

Structs are initialized by:

1. Referencing the name of the struct
2. Passing zero, any or all of the fields of the struct.

The fields without a value will be initialized with zero-values by default.

```golang
// Initialization
b := Box{1, 2}
```

## Pointers

Pointers contain the memory address of the variable they are based on. Pointers used `*`.

```golang
// Declaration of a pointer with *
var p *int
```

```golang
someInteger := 42

// Create pointer from variable using "&"
p = &someInteger
```

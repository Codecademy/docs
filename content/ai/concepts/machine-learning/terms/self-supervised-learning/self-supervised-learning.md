**Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)** is a branch of machine learning that falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It enables models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data by generating pseudo-labels through pretext tasks.

SSL is commonly used in domains such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and speech recognition.

## Syntax

Self-supervised learning does not have a strict syntax but typically follows these steps:

1. **Pretext Task Creation**: Define a task where the model generates labels from input data.
2. **Feature Learning**: Train a model using the pretext task.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Transfer learned features to a downstream task.

For example, in computer vision, a common pretext task is predicting missing parts of an image:

```pseudo
# Pseudo code for an SSL pipeline
Initialize model
For each epoch:
    - Apply transformation to image
    - Train model to predict original image
    - Optimize using loss function
Save learned representation
```

## Example

In Python, SSL can be implemented using PyTorch. The following example demonstrates a simple contrastive learning approach:

```py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleSSLModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(SimpleSSLModel, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, input_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.encoder(x)

# Generate random input data
data = torch.randn(100, 20)

# Define model, loss function, and optimizer
model = SimpleSSLModel(input_dim=20, hidden_dim=10)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop for self-supervised learning
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, data)  # Predict original data from transformed input
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Self-supervised model training complete!")
```

This approach trains a model to reconstruct input data, allowing it to learn meaningful features without labeled supervision.

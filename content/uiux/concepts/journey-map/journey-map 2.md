A **Journey Map** is a visualization of a person's process to accomplish a goal. In basic form, the journey mapping starts by compiling a series of user actions into a timeline. Then, the timeline is fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions to create a narrative that best fits that user's persona throughout the customer's journey.

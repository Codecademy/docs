**Sketching** is used to create quick concepts and to [iterate](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/iterative-process) ideas in a [low-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/low-fidelity) format using pen and paper or a digital sketching app.

Before using [design software](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-software) to create [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe) and interactive prototypes, [sketching](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/sketching) is used to flesh out ideas and approximate content layouts, all in a low-risk environment. [High fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/high-fidelity) elements such as font selection, imagery, and color palettes are not the primary area of focus during this stage in product development.

An X coordinate and a Y coordinate indicate the location of a point along the X-axis (horizontal) and Y-axis (vertical).

In design software, X and Y coordinates reflect the layer’s location on the canvas. If a layer is inside a frame, the coordinates represent its position within the frame.

X and Y coordinates represent the position of a single point &mdash a layer’s X and Y coordinates correlate to the point at the top left corner of its bounds.

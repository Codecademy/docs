**Deliverables** are what is produced when working toward a goal or outcome.

In the world of [user interface](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ui-design) and [user experience](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ux-design) design, deliverables such as [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research), [sketches](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/sketching), [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe), and prototypes are several milestone deliverables to create in the product development process.

## Types of UX Deliverables

UX deliverables vary depending on the project phase, team size, and goals. Some of the most common types include:

- **User research reports:** Summarize interviews, surveys, usability tests, or diary studies findings. Often includes themes, insights, and opportunities.
- **Personas:** Representations of user types, including behaviors, goals, and pain points. Personas help teams align on who they are designing for.
- **Customer journey maps:** Visual timelines of a user's interaction with a product or service, highlighting touchpoints, emotions, and pain points.
- **Task flows and user flows:** Diagrams showing step-by-step paths a user takes to complete specific tasks or reach a goal.
- **Wireframes:** Low-fidelity layouts that outline basic structure and content without detailed styling. Used to align on the layout early.
- **Prototypes:** Interactive versions of a design used for testing or stakeholder demos. They may be low-fidelity (clickable wireframes) or high-fidelity (polished UI mockups).
- **Design systems or UI kits:** Collections of reusable components, styles, and patterns to ensure consistency across an interface.
- **Accessibility documentation:** Notes or specs highlighting how the design meets accessibility standards, such as contrast ratios or keyboard navigability.

## When are Deliverables Created

UX deliverables are created throughout the **design process**, from early discovery to final handoff:

- **During discovery and research:** Research plans, interview scripts, personas, and research summaries are common early-phase deliverables.
- **During design and exploration:** Wireframes, sketches, mood boards, or early prototypes are shared to get alignment on structure and direction.
- **During testing and iteration:** Updated prototypes, annotated screens, or usability test plans and results are created to capture progress and findings.
- **During delivery or handoff:** Final designs, redlines, interaction specs, and documentation are packaged for handoff to engineering or development teams.

**Visual design principles** are guidelines for creating visual designs that are effective, cohesive, and appealing. Common principles include hierarchy, contrast, balance, scale, dominance, unity, and Gestalt.

- **Hierarchy** relates to the order that a person processes visual information. An interface with a clear hierarchy helps the user prioritize information and systematically view elements on the page. By contrast, a lack of hierarchy creates confusion, as it’s unclear what to focus on.
- **Contrast** is used to make elements stand out. Adjusting properties like color, texture, shape, size, and placement can visually distinguish some objects from others on a page.
- **Balance** is achieved when elements appear to be equally distributed on a page. Balance can be created even if elements on a page aren’t perfectly symmetrical.
- **Scale** is used to convey the proportional relationship between objects. Using scale strategically helps users understand how objects in a design relate to each other.
- **Dominance** is used to make one object the focal point of a page or section. Dominance can be incorporated by making one element stand out based on size, shape, color, or other properties.
- **Unity** is achieved when all elements work together as a cohesive whole. In products that follow the unity principle, all elements and layouts feel like they belong together.
- **Gestalt** relates to how the brain processes visual information. When initially viewing a digital interface, a person perceives the overall design rather than isolating individual elements. The brain naturally categorizes and organizes visual information to make sense of it.

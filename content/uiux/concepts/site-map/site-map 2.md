A **site map** is a high-level representation of [content hierarchy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/content-hierarchy) within a digital interface. Site maps define all pages that need to be built and how the content will be organized.

The site map example features an assortment of tiered blocks interconnected with lines. The blocks represent pages, and the lines represent hierarchical relationships between specific pages. The [homepage](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/homepage) in this example is at the top of the site map and encompasses the catalog, resources, and community pages. Challenges, articles, videos, and projects are sub-pages under the resources page.

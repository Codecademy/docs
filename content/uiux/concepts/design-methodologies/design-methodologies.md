**Design methodologies** are systems or models that offer structure or consistency to focus on problems and drive success within a design process.

Methodologies help align all stakeholders within a project, an organization, or an industry. Some popular design methodologies include the [product development life cycle (PDLC)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/product-development-life-cycle), [double diamond diagram](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/double-diamond-diagram), [design thinking](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-thinking), and [user-centered design (UCD)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-centered-design). These processes often emphasize an iterative, cyclical approach to design, incorporating [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) to drive decisions from defining a problem to building a solution.

Over the years, organizations like [Ideo](https://designthinking.ideo.com/), [Google](https://design.google/resources/), and the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com), as well as people like [Peter Morville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Morville), have defined some of the most popular methodologies for executing and assessing UI and UX design. New methodologies and principles are defined constantly within design &mdash; for example, [design justice](https://designjustice.org/) and Microsoft's [inclusive design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) emphasize diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Some designers or firms may specialize in specific methodologies, while others use a mixture of methods to suit a given situation or problem.

**Usability testing** is a UX research method used to evaluate how easily users can complete tasks using a product, service, or interface. It provides direct insights into how people interact with a design and where they encounter confusion, friction, or failure.

Unlike surveys or focus groups, usability testing is task-based. Participants attempt real tasks while researchers observe behavior and collect feedback.

## When and Why It’s Used

Usability testing can occur at any stage of the product development cycle:

- _Early stages._  
  Run with wireframes or prototypes to test layout, interaction logic, and navigation.

- _Post-launch._  
  Identify usability issues in live products and gather insights for iteration.

- _Before handoff._  
  Confirm that flows such as onboarding or checkout are intuitive and error-free.

- _Comparative testing._  
  Compare multiple designs to measure differences in task success or satisfaction.

## Key Elements of a Usability Test

- _Defined tasks._  
  Users complete realistic actions like “Find the return policy” or “Add an item to the cart.”

- _Representative users._  
  Participants reflect real users in goals, experience, and accessibility needs.

- _Observation and note-taking._  
  Researchers record hesitation, navigation patterns, and verbal feedback.

- _Think-aloud protocol._  
  Users are encouraged to speak their thoughts during tasks to reveal friction points.

- _Success metrics._  
  Metrics such as task completion rate, time on task, and error frequency complement qualitative feedback.

> _Note: Usability testing evaluates the interface — not the user. It surfaces design flaws, not personal failures._

## Types of Usability Testing for UX Designers

The format of a usability test depends on context, goals, and constraints:

- _Moderated vs. Unmoderated_
- _Remote vs. In-Person_
- _Qualitative vs. Quantitative_

These categories can be combined to match project needs.

### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Usability Testing

- _Qualitative testing_ captures observations and open-ended feedback.  
  Example: A user explains aloud why they struggle to submit a form.

- _Quantitative testing_ collects measurable outcomes like task time or success rates.  
  Example: 60% of users complete a payment task within 2 minutes.

_Use qualitative testing_ to explore new designs. _Use quantitative testing_ to validate or benchmark results.

### Moderated vs. Unmoderated Usability Testing

- _Moderated testing_ is guided by a researcher in real time.

  - Useful for exploratory feedback and live follow-up.
  - Requires more planning and facilitation.

- _Unmoderated testing_ is completed independently by users.
  - Efficient and scalable with platforms like Maze or Useberry.
  - No opportunity to clarify confusion in the moment.

### Remote vs. In-Person Usability Testing

- _Remote testing_ takes place via screen share or automated platforms.

  - Convenient and diverse.
  - Reflects real-world use environments.

- _In-person testing_ is done in labs or observed spaces.
  - Enables observation of gestures, expressions, and physical behavior.
  - Often used for physical products or accessibility research.

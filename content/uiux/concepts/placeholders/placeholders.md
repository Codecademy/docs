When creating early-stage [sketches](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/sketching) or [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe), [low-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/low-fidelity) **placeholders** are used to represent [high-fidelity](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/high-fidelity) content such as text, images, and videos. [Wireframe elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe-elements) serve as placeholder content, indicating the use and placement of an element without emphasizing its final visual appearance.

## Purpose of Placeholders in Design

Placeholders help designers and stakeholders focus on layout and interaction flow without getting distracted by details such as final copy or image styling.

They are often used in:

- Low-fidelity wireframes to represent headings, paragraphs, and buttons using grey boxes or "lorem ipsum" text.
- Content planning sessions to mark where dynamic or pending assets (such as videos or embedded charts) will go.
- Prototyping when functionality needs to be tested before assets are finalized.

## Types of Placeholders

Common forms of placeholders include:

- **Text placeholders:** Generic copy such as “Headline here” or “Lorem ipsum” to represent future body content.
- **Image placeholders:** Grey boxes or icons marked with an 'X', a camera symbol, or image dimensions (e.g., 800×600).
- **UI component placeholders:** Blocks or lines indicating future dropdowns, tabs, or carousels in a layout.
- **Loading placeholders (skeleton screens):** Shimmering or animated blocks displayed while real data is being fetched — often used in modern web applications.

> **Note:** Skeleton screens are a special category of placeholders focused on perceived performance rather than structural design.

**Design components** are specific examples of design elements that might exist within a given context. They can be thought of like building blocks for design, which are often documented within a **component library** as part of a larger [design system](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-system). Examples of design components could include elements such as buttons, headings, icons, form fields, and menus.

To dive deeper into one example, a [button](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/button) designed in accordance with the [style guide](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/style-guide) for a specific website or brand would qualify as a component. Buttons are clickable elements often used to highlight certain calls-to-action or links on a website, and are a common design pattern used across all kinds of websites and applications.

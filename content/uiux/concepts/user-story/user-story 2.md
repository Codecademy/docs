A **user story** is a concise, informal statement that describes an interaction between a [user](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-and-end-user) and a product or service. User stories typically consist of a single sentence, are written in the first person, and use non-technical language to convey the user’s goals and desired outcomes.

Generally, a user story is formatted as follows:

```plaintext
As a [type of user], I [want to], [so that].
```

## Components and Examples

Effective user stories use clear terms to outline the _who_, _what_, and _why_ of an interaction between a user and a product or system. Here, _who_ indicates an individual user or user group, _what_ points to a specific action that the user or user group expects to complete, and _why_ specifies the desired outcome of the interaction.

Here are some examples of user stories:

```plaintext
As a student (who), I want to find available books by subject (what), so that I can study in an effective manner (why).
```

```plaintext
As an online shopper (who), I want to filter items by sale price (what), so that I can save money (why).
```

```plaintext
As a subscriber to a movie portal (who), I want to search for shows by genre (what), so that I can watch what excites me (why).
```

## Benefits of User Stories

User stories are an essential tool in [user experience (UX) design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ux-design), keeping the focus on the user’s needs and goals by allowing designers to better empathize with the user. Additionally, user stories:

- Aid in communication among [stakeholders](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/stakeholder) by explicitly detailing design requirements in an accessible, easy-to-understand manner.
- Allow designers to better contextualize a user’s interaction with a platform, design, or service and identify gaps or inconsistencies within a design.
- Are a pivotal element within [Agile](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-development-life-cycle/agile-model) project management methodologies that help teams to capture requirements and create smaller, more manageable units of work.
- Provide a means to prioritize design efforts by identifying the workflows that are most essential to the user.

A **logo** is a symbol, graphic, or emblem, that is used to represent a company, product, or brand. A logo presents a unique opportunity for companies to stand out and create a brand identity that assists in brand recognition. Additionally, the color of a logo plays a significant role in how a brand is perceived based on the emotional response it creates.

Companies such as [Google](https://www.google.com), [Nike](https://www.nike.com), [Apple](https://www.apple.com), [McDonald’s](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html), and, last but not least, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), have logos that are recognized around the world.

## Logo Variations and Formats

Digital products require flexible logo systems that adapt across contexts. Common formats include:

- **Primary logo:** The full version, including both symbol and wordmark.
- **Logomark only:** A standalone icon or symbol used when the full logo is unnecessary or unsuitable.
- **Responsive logo:** A simplified version used in small spaces like navbars or tab icons.
- **Monochrome or inverted logo:** Versions designed for dark mode, grayscale, or print compatibility.

> **Note:** A logo must remain legible and balanced across formats, screen sizes, and accessibility contexts.

## What does a Logo Communicate about a Brand

A logo conveys subtle but powerful messages about the brand:

- **Tone of voice:** A logo sets expectations — playful, professional, experimental, minimalist.
- **Industry or domain cues:** Symbols, colors, and typefaces suggest alignment with sectors like education, health, or finance.
- **Company values:** Visual traits signal identity — bold vs. quiet, modern vs. traditional, innovative vs. stable.

**Thematic analysis** is a qualitative research method that can be used to gain insights on UI/UX. It is performed by examining qualitative data (e.g., results from user interviews or feedback forms), identifying patterns within it, categorizing it using codes, and using those codes to determine themes. This results in a clear set of actionable insights to be worked on.

## Codes

Codes are used to identify common topics of interest, functioning as tags for categorizing data. For example, a thematic analysis of feedback for a messaging app may include codes such as "interface," "functionality," and "accessibility," documenting the comments made about each aspect of the application.

## Themes

Once the data has been categorized, themes can be determined within the created codes. A theme is a core idea obtained by observing similar concepts within a code, indicating something about user needs or preferences, and providing meaningful insights.

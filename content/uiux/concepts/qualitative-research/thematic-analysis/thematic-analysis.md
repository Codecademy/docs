**Thematic analysis** is done by examining qualitative data (e.g. results from user interviews or feedback forms) and identifying patterns within it, categorizing it using **codes** and using those codes to determine **themes**. This results in a clear set of actionable insights to be worked on.

## Codes
Codes are used to identify common topics of interest, functioning as tags for categorizing data. For example, a thematic analysis of feedback for a messaging app may include codes such as "interface," "functionality," and "accessibility," documenting the comments made about each aspect of the application.

## Themes
Once the data has been categorized, themes can be determined within the created codes. A theme is a core idea that is obtained through observing similar concepts within a code, indicating something about user needs or preferences, and providing meaningful insights.

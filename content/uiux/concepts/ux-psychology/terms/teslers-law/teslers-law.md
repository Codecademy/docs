**Tesler's Law**, also called the _Law of Conservation of Complexity_, is a principle of interaction design that says:

> Every application has an inherent amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is who will have to deal with it — the user, the system, or the designer. — Larry Tesler, Apple Human Factors Engineer

In other words, complexity cannot be eliminated entirely — but it can be managed by the user, the design, or the technology. Tesler’s Law reminds UX designers to shield users from unnecessary complexity by taking on that burden through thoughtful design.

## What It Means in UX

In practice, Tesler's Law is about _minimizing the cognitive load_ on users. If an interaction is too complex, users get overwhelmed or frustrated. If designers and developers can anticipate those challenges and simplify the experience through better workflows, defaults, or automation, user satisfaction increases.

## Why It Matters

Every product, form, or flow contains decisions, logic, or steps that require effort. The trick is to _move that effort away from the user whenever possible_.

## Benefits of applying Tesler's Law

- **Simplifies task completion:** Users are more likely to finish tasks if they do not have to think too hard or manage too many options.
- **Reduces cognitive overload:** Clear interfaces with minimal decision points help users focus on what matters.
- **Improves accessibility and inclusivity:** Simplified paths are more usable by a broader range of users with diverse needs and abilities.
- **Enhances trust and usability:** Products that just work create positive emotional responses and deeper engagement.

## Where Does Tesler's Law Apply

Tesler's Law applies to nearly every interaction where complexity can be shifted from the user to the system. Common areas include:

- **Forms and input flows:** Break large forms into manageable steps. Use smart defaults and pre-filled data to reduce effort.
- **Search and filtering:** Auto-suggest, predictive text, or filters that adapt to context reduce the burden of choosing from large data sets.
- **Settings and preferences:** Hide advanced controls unless needed. Most users prefer sensible defaults over dozens of confusing options.
- **Error handling:** Instead of rejecting bad input, anticipate common mistakes and guide users gently to the correct format.

## How to Design with Tesler's Law in Mind

- **Automate when possible:** Autofill addresses, calculate totals, infer context, anything that spares the user from doing it manually.
- **Reduce decision-making points:** Offer fewer, more meaningful options. Avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary choices.
- **Progressively disclose complexity:** Keep interfaces simple up front. Reveal advanced features or controls only when needed.
- **Use defaults intelligently:** Pre-select the most likely option based on context, past behavior, or best practices.
- **Write clear, focused microcopy:** Good UX writing reduces confusion and speeds up task flow, especially when actions have consequences.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Some complexity must be shown when users need control or transparency.
- Hiding too much detail can make advanced use cases harder.
- Simplifying for one user group may make things harder for another — always validate with real users.

Tesler's Law is about choosing _who absorbs the complexity_ — and as UX professionals, we should take on as much of that responsibility as possible to create seamless, humane digital experiences.

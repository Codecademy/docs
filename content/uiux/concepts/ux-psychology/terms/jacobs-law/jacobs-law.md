**Jacob’s Law**, proposed by Jakob Nielsen, highlights a key UX design principle: users spend most of their time on other applications and websites, which shapes their expectations for how interfaces should work. Instead of creating entirely unique designs, aligning with familiar patterns and conventions results in a smoother user experience and reduces cognitive friction.

This law emphasizes the importance of consistency and convention in design. We minimize confusion and enhance usability by meeting users' expectations based on their prior experiences. Innovative or visually appealing designs can cause frustration if they deviate too much from established norms.

## Example

A common example of Jacob’s Law in practice is navigation design. Most users expect the navigation bar to be at the top of a webpage, with a logo on the left and clickable links for main sections. Moving this navigation to an unexpected place or using unfamiliar icons without labels can negatively affect usability.

Designing interfaces that follow familiar patterns helps users feel comfortable and navigate efficiently.

### Why Jacob’s Law Matters

Research from Nielsen Norman Group indicates that familiar interfaces reduce cognitive load, improving task success and satisfaction. Products that align with users' expectations are easier to learn and use — increasing retention and reducing support needs.

### Common Applications

E-commerce platforms like Amazon, ASOS, and Shopify consistently place shopping carts in the top-right corner — a convention users now expect. Mobile apps, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, follow platform-specific design patterns, like bottom navigation on iOS, to ensure consistency and ease of use.

### Exceptions & When to Innovate

Tools like Notion and Figma break certain design conventions to serve expert or niche users. Innovation works when usability remains high and users see clear benefits. Even these platforms retain core UX norms, such as consistent icons and layout grids, to reduce the learning curve.

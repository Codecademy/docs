**Jacob’s Law**, proposed by Jakob Nielsen, highlights an important principle in UX Design: users spend most of their time on other websites and applications, which shapes their expectations for how things should work. Rather than creating entirely unique designs or interfaces, aligning with familiar patterns and conventions leads to smoother user experiences and less cognitive friction.

This law underlines the importance of consistency and convention in design. Meeting users' expectations based on their existing experiences is how we reduce confusion and increase usability. Unfamiliar or overly original designs often lead to frustration, even if they are innovative or visually appealing.

## Example

A common example of Jacob’s Law in practice is navigation design where most users expect the navigation bar to be at the top of a webpage, with a logo on the left and clickable links for main sections. Moving this navigation to an unexpected place, or using unfamiliar icons without labels, can negatively affect usability.

You help them feel more comfortable and efficient when using your product by designing interfaces that follow patterns users have seen on other platforms.

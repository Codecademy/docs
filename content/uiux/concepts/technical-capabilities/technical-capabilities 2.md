**Technical capabilities** refer to the limitations of what is possible for a product development team. Variables to consider include:

- **Design capabilities**: After brainstorming, sketching, and wireframing, it's time to transition concepts and ideas into testable prototypes. Are the proposed concepts possible to recreate in a design software environment and within the capabilities of the design team?

- **Development capabilities**: Are the designs presented to the development team feasible and realistic to create given the project timeline, team size, and allocated budget?

- **Project Timeline**: Is the project delivery date realistic considering the design and development capabilities, budget, and assigned workforce? Does the timeline allow for project redesign and rework?

- **Researcher-Designer-Developer ratio**: This ratio refers to the number of researchers-to-designers-to-developers working on UX and design teams. Based on a [study conducted by Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-developer-ratio/) in 2020, the ratio was found to be around 1:5:50 for Researcher-to-Designer-to-Developer.

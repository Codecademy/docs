**Focus groups** are a [user research method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) in which a moderator guides a group of participants (typically 4-12 users) through a series of questions about a topic, product, or design. These questions help researchers understand the in-depth motivations and thought processes behind the user experience. Because the data is self-reported by users, focus groups are also considered an [attitudinal research method](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/attitudinal-research). Some fields of study that utilize focus groups are market research, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and [User Experience (UX) Design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ux-design).

Focus groups can be more cost- and time-efficient compared to one-on-one [interviews](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/interviews), as researchers can gather feedback from a diverse group of participants all at once. The real-time group dynamic of focus groups may also encourage participants to open up and share their thoughts more than they would with other methodologies, such as [surveys](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/surveys).

The following are some examples of qualitative data that can be obtained through focus groups:

- **User Perspectives:** How users interact with or think about a product or service.
- **User Feedback:** Direct feedback on design elements, usability, and overall user experience.
- **Pain Points:** Any challenges or difficulties users may face when using a product.
- **Design Improvements:** User-driven suggestions on how a product or concept could be improved.

## Focus Group Methodology

A typical focus group involves the following steps:

1. **Participant Selection:** Researchers select a diverse group of users representing the target demographic, usually through a screening process.
2. **Preparation of Materials:** Researchers prepare materials such as prototypes, wireframes, or design concepts for evaluation.
3. **Facilitation:** During the focus group, a moderator guides the discussion and encourages participants to express their thoughts, opinions, and concerns.
4. **Observation:** Researchers observe the session, noting participants' reactions and feedback.
5. **Post-Session Analysis:** Researchers analyze the collected data to derive actionable insights for design improvements.

A focus group may also integrate activities like collaging, drawing, brainstorming with sticky notes, card-sorting, or role-playing to increase participant engagement and break away from the standard question-and-answer format.

## Best Practices for Focus Groups

Some principles to keep in mind when conducting a focus group are:

- **Diversity:** Select participants who represent a range of demographics, including age, gender, and technological proficiency.
- **Clear Objectives:** Clearly define the goals of the focus group for effective discussions.
- **Neutral Facilitation:** Emphasize neutral moderation and encourage honest feedback.
- **User Interactivity:** Incorporate prototypes or interactive elements to enhance user engagement.
- **User-centric Storytelling:** Contextualize discussions with real-life scenarios or user stories.

**Tree Testing** is a [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) method where researchers evaluate how easily users can find information in a hierarchical structure without the aid of visual design. This method is often used to validate [information architecture](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/information-architecture) and navigation structures before any wireframes or user interfaces are created.

There are several tools used to conduct a tree testing session. These include platforms such as [Treejack](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack/), [UserZoom](https://www.userzoom.com/), [UXtweak](https://www.uxtweak.com/), and [Usabilitree](https://www.usabilitree.com/). Tree testing typically involves giving participants a task, and asking them to navigate through a simplified site structure to locate the required information.

## Task-Based Navigation

Tree testing tasks are written as specific goals, such as:

```plaintext
Where would someone go to update their account settings?
```

Participants then click through the tree structure to identify where they think that information would be located.

Researchers observe whether participants make the correct selections, how long it takes, and whether they backtrack. This helps identify where the structure is intuitive or where participants may get lost.

## Moderated vs. Unmoderated Tree Testing

Moderated tree testing is when the researcher observes the participant while tasks are being completed and can ask questions or clarify instructions. This approach provides additional context around user decisions and confusion points.

Unmoderated tree testing is conducted remotely without researcher interaction. It is often used for large-scale studies and produces quantitative data about success rates and navigation paths. One limitation is that researchers may miss out on the _why_ behind user decisions.

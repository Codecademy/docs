**Tree testing** is a usability testing method used to evaluate the structure of a website or app by analyzing how users navigate through a simplified version of its hierarchy. This method helps designers and researchers understand whether users can find information easily and if the content organization aligns with user expectations.

Tree testing is typically conducted using a text-based representation of the website or app's structure, without any visual design elements. Participants are given specific tasks, such as locating a particular piece of information, and their navigation paths are tracked to identify areas of confusion or inefficiency.

## How Tree Testing is Used in UI/UX Design

Tree testing is particularly useful during the early stages of design when the focus is on information architecture rather than visual design. It allows teams to:

- Validate the effectiveness of a proposed navigation structure.
- Identify areas where users struggle to find information.
- Compare different versions of a hierarchy to determine which performs better.

By focusing on the structure alone, tree testing eliminates distractions caused by visual design, enabling researchers to pinpoint issues in the content organization.

## Tools for Tree Testing

Several tools are available to facilitate tree testing, including:

- [Optimal Workshop's Treejack](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack)
- [UsabilityHub](https://usabilityhub.com/)
- [UserZoom](https://www.userzoom.com/)

These tools allow researchers to create tree tests, recruit participants, and analyze results efficiently.

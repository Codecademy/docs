**Navigation** allows users to travel through a digital interface and interact with elements such as [links](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/links) and [buttons](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/button). Interacting with these elements can result in internal or external navigation.

Internal navigation directs users to a location within the same website or interface. For example, navigating to the products page from the homepage of the same website is internal navigation.

External navigation is when a user clicks a link and is redirected from one website to another. For example, a user on the [Codecademy website](https://www.codecademy.com) clicks a link and is redirected to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) to watch a video. This is considered external navigation because the user travels from one website (Codecademy) to another (YouTube).

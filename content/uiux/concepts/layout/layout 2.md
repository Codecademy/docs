**Layout** refers to how [visual design elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/visual-design-elements) are organized on a page. To create effective layouts, designers consider hierarchy, balance, and other [visual design principles](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/visual-design-principles).

## Common Layouts

Standard patterns and existing products are helpful sources of inspiration for designing layouts. Common layouts use visual design and Gestalt principles.

Here are a few common web layouts:

### Grid

A **grid** layout works well for designs that have a lot of similar elements, such as this course catalog page. There are many cards, as each represents a course. Placing the cards on a grid keeps them organized and allows users to easily scan them.

### Split

A **split-screen** layout is a good option for dividing a page into two distinct sections. This page is divided into information (left side) and action (right side).

### Single-Column

A **single-column** layout can work well for text-heavy pages. The article text is displayed in a wide column that takes up most of the page.

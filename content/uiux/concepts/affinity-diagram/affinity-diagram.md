**Affinity diagrams** are a visual method used in UX to organize large qualitative data sets into meaningful groups. It helps designers synthesize research findings, uncover themes, and prioritize user needs by clustering related insights.

> In UX, qualitative data includes open-ended user quotes, observed behaviors, emotional reactions, or pain points—anything that is not easily measured with numbers.

This method is especially useful during the **synthesis phase** of research, where raw data is analyzed to identify recurring patterns, user needs, or design opportunities.

## When to Create an Affinity Diagram

Affinity diagrams are typically created after collecting qualitative data such as:

- Interview quotes or observations
- Survey responses
- Notes from usability tests
- Brainstorming ideas from team sessions

They are commonly used during:

- Research synthesis
- Problem framing
- Ideation and early concept planning
- Stakeholder alignment workshops

## How to Build an Affinity Diagram

1. **Gather raw data or observations:** Pull relevant user quotes, ideas, pain points, or behavioral notes onto individual cards or sticky notes. Each card should contain one point or idea.
2. **Sort items into related groups:** Without labels, begin clustering related notes based on similarity. This should be done collaboratively to uncover patterns through discussion.
3. **Label the clusters:** Once groups emerge, give each one a meaningful heading that captures the underlying theme or insight, such as "Trust issues" or "Onboarding friction."

> For example, quotes like *“I don’t trust the payment screen”* and *“I'm afraid my card will get charged twice”* might be grouped under **"Trust Issues."**

4. **Prioritize insights if needed:** Some clusters may represent more critical issues than others. Use dot-voting or effort-impact axes to highlight which themes require action.

## Benefits of Using Affinity Diagrams

- **Promotes shared understanding:** Team members synthesize data together, helping align on core themes and reduce bias.
- **Visualizes complexity:** Turning unstructured data into structured clusters helps reveal patterns and gaps that are difficult to identify in raw notes.
- **Encourages collaboration:** They are especially effective in workshops or design studios where cross-functional teams collaborate to interpret findings.
- **Enables informed decisions:** Synthesized insights can inform product roadmaps, feature prioritization, and persona development.

## Tools to Create Affinity Diagrams

Affinity diagrams can be created using physical and digital tools, depending on the team's needs and setting. While sticky notes and whiteboards are great for in-person sessions, remote or hybrid teams benefit from digital collaboration platforms. Popular tools include:

- [**Miro:**](https://miro.com) A versatile online whiteboard that supports sticky notes, clustering, voting, and templates tailored for UX workshops.
- [**MURAL:**](https://www.mural.co/) Offers powerful features for organizing qualitative data, with a focus on team facilitation and design thinking.
- [**FigJam:**](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) A lightweight whiteboard tool by Figma, ideal for quick brainstorming and affinity diagramming within design teams.
- [**Figma:**](https://www.figma.com/) Though primarily a UI/UX design tool, it can also be used creatively for diagramming using shapes, components, and team collaboration features.

Choose a tool based on your team's workflow, the amount of data, and the need for interactivity and visual structure.

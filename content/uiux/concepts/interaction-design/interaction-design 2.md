**Interaction design** (IxD) is a design discipline that focuses on designing products that users can successfully interact with.

When using digital products, there is a back-and-forth pattern that mirrors a conversation &mdash; the user takes an action, and the interface responds. Interaction design is like planning a conversation between the user and the interface.

## IxD vs. UXD

[UX design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ux-design) encompasses all aspects of a user-centered design process, from conducting [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) to creating [wireframes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/wireframe) and [prototypes](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/prototype) to facilitating usability tests.

Interaction design is a subsection of UX design. IxD focuses on the interactions between the user and the product, such as typing, scrolling, swiping, tapping, pinching, double-clicking, hovering, and more. Interaction designers plan and prototype the interactions that allow the user to achieve their goals.

The roles of UX designer and interaction designer can overlap. UX designers may be responsible for interaction design and other aspects of the design process. In some contexts, specialized interaction designer roles focus solely on planning and creating interactions.

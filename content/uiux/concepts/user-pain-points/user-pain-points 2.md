**User Pain Points** are areas of difficulty or frustration for a user when using a product that makes the experience undesirable. These can be minor inconveniences or issues preventing users from accessing the product or service entirely. User Pain Points can also be difficulties users face with their daily tasks. Such problems are identified at the beginning of the product development process, to build user-centric solutions. They can be identified through User Research within the User Experience (UX) design process.

**Think Aloud Protocol** is a [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research) method where participants are asked to express their thoughts in words while completing a task. This technique provides insight into the user's decision-making process, confusion points, and assumptions, all in real time.

It is widely used in usability testing to understand the way users perceive and interact with a product or interface. Researchers listen, observe, and record the participant's spoken thoughts to gain a deeper understanding of user experience.

## When to Use

The Think-Aloud Protocol is best suited for:

- Usability testing of new designs or prototypes
- Early discovery research
- Identifying pain points in user flows
- Evaluating information architecture clarity

## Example Scenario

A participant is asked to find and apply a promo code on an e-commerce checkout page. As they interact with the interface, they might say:

- "I'm looking for a place where I can enter the code."
- "Oh, it's probably under this dropdown."
- "I thought it would be closer to the total price."

These comments reveal where the design may not match the user's mental model.

## Best Practices

- Prompt users to "keep talking" if they go quiet, but don't lead them.
- Use screen and voice recording tools to capture the session.
- Combine with other methods (e.g., observation or screen heatmaps) for richer insights.
- Debrief immediately after to clarify unclear moments.

## Limitations

- May not reflect natural user behavior due to the artificial setting.
- Some participants may struggle to articulate their thoughts.
- Not ideal for tasks requiring intense concentration.

**Scenario mapping** is a collaborative UX method for visualizing how users interact with a product in different real-world contexts. Mapping scenarios (or situations) to specific features and solutions helps teams align around user goals, pain points, and workflows.

Scenario mapping combines insights from user research, personas, and jobs-to-be-done frameworks to create a shared understanding of how people use products in varying situations and what support they need to succeed.

## What is a Scenario?

In UX, a scenario describes a short, narrative-based situation where a user tries to accomplish a specific task under certain conditions. These stories are fictional but rooted in fundamental research and help reveal the context in which users interact with a product.

Example scenario:

> Lisa is trying to check out quickly on her phone during her lunch break, but she cannot remember her password and does not have time to reset it.

## Why Use Scenario Mapping?

Scenario mapping helps teams understand user behavior in a structured, task-oriented way. It surfaces design opportunities and usability gaps before wireframes or prototypes are even created.

### Key Benefits

- **Keeps design grounded in real-world behavior**: Mapping scenarios forces teams to think about why, when, and how users will engage with features â€” not just what the features are.
- **Supports cross-functional alignment**: Designers, researchers, developers, and stakeholders can collaborate to explore pain points, edge cases, and user needs.
- **Improves feature prioritization**: Examining which scenarios occur most often or have the highest risk of failure allows teams to pay attention to the most impactful solutions.
- **Encourages empathy and user-centric thinking**: Thinking through scenarios encourages teams to consider the user's mindset, emotions, and goals, not just interface mechanics.

## When to Use Scenario Mapping

Scenario mapping is most useful during:

- **Early ideation or discovery phases**: To explore how people might use your product in different contexts.
- **Design sprints and workshops**: To gather real-time cross-disciplinary insights.
- **Feature planning**: To understand what workflows need to be supported or simplified.
- **Post-research synthesis**: Connect interview data with actionable design opportunities.

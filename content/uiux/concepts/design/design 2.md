**Design** is an intentional problem-solving process focused on planning or making something for a specific use or purpose.

While "design" is often equated with graphic design or visual design, _design_ is a vast discipline with many subdisciplines &mdash; including everything from industrial design to service design. Merriam-Webster offers one appropriately broad [definition of design](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/design): "to plan and make (something) for a specific use or purpose." Design can include tasks ranging from thinking about what color a button should be on a screen, to deciding how passengers should flow through an airport.

The authors of [Visual Communication Design: An Introduction to Design Concepts in Everyday Experience](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/visual-communication-design-9781474221573/) suggest that professional practice of design has experienced a shift from "designing objects to designing the conditions for experience." In recent years, [user interface (UI) design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ui-design) and [user experience (UX) design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ux-design) have been at the forefront of conversations about design.

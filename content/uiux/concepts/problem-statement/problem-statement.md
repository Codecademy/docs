A **problem statement** succinctly describes what problem a design will attempt to solve. It is a standard output of the define stage of the [design thinking process](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/design-thinking).

Before conducting [user research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/user-research), a preliminary problem statement may be crafted to focus research efforts. After conducting user research, the initial problem statement must be reviewed. Updates should be made to ensure that it accurately reflects a challenge that users are experiencing.

The problem statement will guide decisions throughout the design process. As new information becomes available through research and feedback, it may be necessary to iterate on the problem statement.

## What a Problem Statement Includes

A strong problem statement clearly identifies the **who**, **what**, and **why** behind a design challenge. It avoids jumping to solutions and instead frames the issue in a way that invites multiple creative directions.

Key elements often include:

- **The user or persona affected**

Who is experiencing the problem? Be specific - frequent travelers, first-time users, or non-technical team members are better than just users.

- **The specific problem or friction point**

What is preventing them from achieving their goal? Is it time-consuming, confusing, inaccessible, or inefficient?

- **The context in which the problem occurs**

Where and when does this issue arise? Is it during onboarding, on mobile, while working under time pressure?

- **The impact or consequence**

What happens if this problem is not addressed? Does it lead to abandonment, frustration, or lost revenue?

## Example Problem Statements

Busy commuters struggle to find and download offline maps in our travel app, especially when preparing for trips in low-connectivity areas.

First-time users are overwhelmed by the setup process, which leads to incomplete profiles and high churn within the first week.

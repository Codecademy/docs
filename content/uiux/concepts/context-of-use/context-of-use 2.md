The **context of use** describes the environment and conditions under which a product or design will be used.

[User experience (UX) design](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ux-design) considers the entire experience around a product or service, taking into account the user's emotional state, the context of use or environment, and the designed system or artifact.

Contextual research methods, such as [field studies](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/ethnography-field-studies) and [diary studies](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/diary-study), can provide a deeper understanding of how a design is used in context and ensure that research has high ecological validity or an accurate understanding of how users behave naturally (source: [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/context-methods-field-diary-studies/)).

**Behavioral research** methods observe user behavior through techniques such as ethnographic studies, A/B testing, tree testing, and user testing.

Anthropologist [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead) once said, “What people say, what people do, and what people say they do are entirely different things.” User researchers need to develop strong interpretive and creative skills to get to the core of why people behave the way they do. It's important to combine behavioral research with [attitudinal research](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/uiux/attitudinal-research) for a full understanding of user behavior.

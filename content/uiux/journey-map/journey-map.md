A **Journey Map** is a visualization of a person's process to accomplish a goal. In basic form, the journey mapping starts by compiling a series of user actions into a timeline. Then, the timeline is fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions to create a narrative that best fits that user's persona throughout the customer's journey. 

## How Journey Mapping Is Used In UX

 The Journey Map, helps teams understand and visualize the end-to-end experience of a user as they interact with a product or service. They provide a comprehensive view of the user's interactions, emotions, and touchpoints throughout their journey. These maps are a versatile tool in UX design that aids in understanding, visualizing, and improving the overall user experience by providing a holistic view of the user's journey.

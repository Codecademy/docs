**`Color`** is a structure that creates color instances. Colors can be created from RGB, HSL, or grayscale component values and from standard color properties which are type properties.

`Color` instances (type properties) can be used as arguments, for example, to fill backgrounds and shapes or to apply color to text. They can also be used directly as [views](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swiftui/views), creating a rectangle area filled with their color that adapts to fill the space available.

## Colors from Component Values

Colors can be created from RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), or grayscale component values.

### RGB

RGB colors can be created by specifying the amount of `red`, `green`, and `blue` as a `Double` value (`amount`) between 0 and 255:

```pseudo
let rgbColor = Color(red: amount, green: amount, blue: amount)
```

### HSL

HSL colors can be created by specifying the amount of `hue`, `saturation`, and `lightness` as `Double` values. `hue` requires a value between 0 and 360. `saturation` and `lightness` both require values between 0 and 1.

```pseudo
let hslColor = Color(hue: amount, saturation: amount, lightness: amount)
```

### Grayscale

Grayscale colors can be created by specifying the amount of `white` as a `Double` value between 0 and 1:

```pseudo
let grayscaleColor = Color(white: amount)
```

All colors can also have an optional `opacity` argument with a `Double` value between 0 and 1; the default is 1.

### Example

The following example creates three colors from component values and displays them in a `VStack` as views that fill the available area:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {

        let bubbleGumPink = Color(red: 9.9, green: 0.7, blue: 0.9)
        let fudgeBeige = Color(hue: 0.1, saturation: 0.3, brightness: 0.8)
        let moonGray = Color(white: 0.9, opacity: 0.7)

        VStack {
            bubbleGumPink
            fudgeBeige
            moonGray
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

This will display:

## Standard Color Properties

Colors created from standard color properties can be declared using dot notation or bracket notation:

```pseudo
let someColor = Color.color property
let someColor = Color(.color property and optional color component values)
```

Here are some of the standard color properties that are available. Many of the color properties will change depending on their context, for example, if light or dark mode is set.

- `.red` (context-dependent)
- `.orange` (context-dependent)
- `.green` (context-dependent)
- `.white`
- `.black`
- `.primary` (context-dependent)
- `.secondary` (context-dependent)

### Example

The following example displays some uses for `Color`. An array of colors is declared using standard color properties and used to fill a series of [views](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swiftui/views):

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        // Here, for example, .red is the shorthand for Color.red
        let rainbowColors = [Color.red, Color.orange, Color.yellow, Color.green, Color.mint, Color.teal, Color.cyan, Color.blue, Color.indigo, Color.purple, Color.brown]

        VStack {
            HStack {
                ForEach(rainbowColors, id: \.self) { color in
                    Circle()
                        .fill(color)
                }
            }
            ForEach(rainbowColors, id: \.self) { color in
                color
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

In the example above, the first `ForEach` loop displays a sequence of [`Circle`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swiftui/views/circle)s filled with each color in the `rainbowColors` array. The next `ForEach` loop returns each color in the array, creating a sequence of rectangle [views](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swiftui/views) filled with each color.

This will display:

## Using and Defining Custom Colors in SwiftUI

A good way to define custom colors consistently throughout the app in SwiftUI is by creating a custom color under the Assets Folder in XCode.

To ensure the color is cohesive, add a Hex Number under the Color Set Tab within the Assets folder, as shown below. First, add a color set and give it a name. Call the new Color to use it. It can be `lightGreen`, `appleGreen`, or in our `brandPrimary` as it will be the brandâ€™s main color used throughout the app.

Defining custom colors is helpful because even when the user changes from light to dark mode on their device, the color will be consistent throughout.

### Example

To use the custom color use a modifier that can take in color as an argument such as **.foregroundStyle** or **.tint**.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
      VStack {
        Image(systemName: "leaf")
              .imageScale(.large)
              .foregroundStyle(.brandPrimary)
        Text("Hello, world!")
              .padding()
      }
   }
}
```

The code above results in the view below. The leaf system image below takes up the brand primary color using the **.foregroundStyle** modifier.

The `requests` module is the de facto standard for sending HTTP requests in Python. 

It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a beautiful, simple API so that you can focus on interacting with services and consuming data in your application.

The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).

## Installation

Let’s begin by installing the `requests` module. To do so, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ pip install requests
```

Once `requests` is installed, you can use it in your program. Importing `requests` looks like this:

```py
import requests
```

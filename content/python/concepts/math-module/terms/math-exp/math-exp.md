The `math.exp()` method returns _e_ raised to the power of a number.

## Syntax

```py
math.exp(x)
```

_e_ is approximately 2.718282.

## Example

Use `math.exp()` to return _e_ raised to the power of `5`:

```python
import math

print(math.exp(5)) 
```

The above code give the following output:

```shell
148.4131591025766
```

Use `math.exp()` to return _e_ raised to the power of `3`:

```python
import math

print(math.exp(3))
```

The above code give the following output:

```shell
20.085536923187668
```

## Codebyte Example

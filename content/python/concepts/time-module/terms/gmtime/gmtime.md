The `gmtime()` function is used to convert a time value into a structured representation in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

## Syntax

```pseudo
gmtime([seconds])
```

The optional argument `seconds` is the number of seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). If no argument is provided, the function will use the current time.

## Example

```python
import time

# Get the current time in UTC
current_time = time.gmtime()
print("Current UTC time:", current_time)

# Convert a specific time (e.g., 1st January 2020) to UTC
specific_time = time.mktime((2020, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))
utc_time = time.gmtime(specific_time)
print("Specific UTC time:", utc_time)
```e() function is used to convert a time value into a structured representation in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

## Codebyte Example

```python
import time

# Get the current time in UTC
current_time = time.gmtime()
print("Current UTC time:", current_time)

# Convert a specific time (e.g., 1st January 2020) to UTC
specific_time = time.mktime((2020, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))
utc_time = time.gmtime(specific_time)
print("Specific UTC time:", utc_time)

**.perf_counter_ns()** is a function from the `time` module that returns a **high-resolution** timer value in **nanoseconds** as an **integer**.

## Syntax
```pseudo
time.perf_counter_ns()
```
The syntax for perf_counter_ns() is very simple because it takes **no arguments**.
- **time**: The module name (must be imported first).
- **perf_counter_ns**: The function.
- **( )**: Empty parentheses because it doesn't need parameters.

## Example
The **perf_counter_ns** function can be used to measure elapsed time between two parts of a pipeline by taking timestamps before and after the code and calculating the difference.
```py
import time

start = time.perf_counter_ns()   # start timer
# some code
end = time.perf_counter_ns()     # end timer

print("Elapsed:", end - start, "nanoseconds")
```

## Codebyte Example
This example shows how you can use `perf_counter_ns()` to benchmark even small tasks very precisely.

```codebyte/python
import time
import random

# Create a random list of numbers
numbers = [random.randint(1, 1000000) for _ in range(100000)]

# Start timer
start = time.perf_counter_ns()

# Code we want to measure
numbers.sort()

# End timer
end = time.perf_counter_ns()

# Calculate elapsed time
elapsed_ns = end - start
print(f"Sorting took {elapsed_ns} nanoseconds ({elapsed_ns / 1e6:.3f} ms)")
```

### What is Happening
    1. Generate a list of 100,000 random numbers.
    2. Start the timer before sorting.
    3. End the timer after sorting.
    4. Subtract start from end â†’ gives elapsed time in nanoseconds.
    5. Optionally, convert nanoseconds to milliseconds for easier reading.

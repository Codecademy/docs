**Built-in functions** in Python are a collection of pre-defined functions readily available for use without requiring the import of any external libraries. These functions provide essential functionality for performing common tasks, such as manipulating data types, handling input/output, and more. Python includes over 60 built-in functions, which are categorized and listed alphabetically for easy reference.

## Example

The example below uses a built-in function `len()` that returns the length of an object:

```py
# Creating a list of states
states = ["Idaho", "Kansas", "Louisiana"]

# A string
text = "Hello, World!"

# Calculating the length using len()
print(len(states))
print(len(text))
```

The output of the above code is as follows:

```shell
3
13
```

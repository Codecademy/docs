**Break**
======
The **break** keyword is used to exit a for loop or while loop.

**Syntax**
======
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

    if number == 5:
        break;
```
Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
In the example above, the for loop will iterate through numbers and it will stop the loop when the number is 5.

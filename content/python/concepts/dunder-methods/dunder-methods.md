**Dunder Methods**, alternatively known as **magic methods**, use a special syntax to perform [class](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/classes)-specific operations in Python. Here, "dunder" is the short for "double underscores". The operations that it performs include the following:

- Performing arithmetic operations on numeric-type attributes.
- Initializing a new class instance and binding any necessary attributes.
- Overloading certain methods to make their behaviors unique to that class.

## Syntax

```pseudo
class ClassName:
  __methodname__(self, param1, param2, ... paramN):
    # Method body here
```

The `methodname` is all lowercase even if there is more than one word in the name. The first parameter, `self`, is never explicitly passed as an argument because it refers to the class instance the method would be called against. However, any parameters defined afterward (`param1, param2, ... paramN`) must be passed as arguments when the dunder method is called.

## Example

The following example showcases the [`__init__()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dunder-methods/init) dunder method used for the `Home` class. This particular method will be called each time a new instance of `Home` is created, binding the values of any attributes that were passed:

```py
class Home:
  def __init__(self, rooms):
    self.rooms = rooms

myHome = Home(4)
```

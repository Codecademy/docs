The [**Integrated Development Learning Environment (IDLE)**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) is a cross-platform [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/developer-tools/ide) that offers a minimal code editing experience. It has been included with Python since version 1.5.2b1.

## Installing On Windows

While some Windows machines may already have Python installed, many do not. The latest version of Python 3 can be [downloaded here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

## Installing On macOS

Since Python 2 [was sunset back in 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/), newer versions of macOS are looking to only include Python 3 pre-installed. However, it can still be [downloaded here](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/). IDLE will become available after downloading and can be accessed in the `Python 3.x` folder in the "Applications" section of the Finder.

A **Counter** is a data type in the `collections` module. It is a [`dict`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dictionaries) subclass that stores counts for hashable objects. For each key-value pair, the key is the item being counted, and the value is the count of that object. A `Counter`'s items are accessed just as in a dictionary, except accessing a missing key will return a `0` value rather than an error.

**Note:** A `Counter` will allow negative counts.

## Syntax

```pseudo
myCollection = collections.Counter()
```

A `Counter` can also be initialized from an iterable or initialized from another mapping.

## Additional Methods

A `Counter` supplies the following additional methods beyond those for a standard dictionary:

- `.elements()`: Returns an iterator for the keys of the `Counter` repeating each element as many times as its count. It will ignore items with a count of less than one.
- `.most_common(n)`: Returns the `n` most common key-count pairs, in descending order of their counts. If `n` is omitted or `None`, the entire contents of the `Collection` are returned.
- `.subtract(values)`: Where `values` is an iterable or mapping. Matching keys have their values subtracted from the elements in the `Counter`. Inputs and outputs can be negative or zero.
- `.total()`: Returns the sum of all the counts.

Other differences from a standard dictionary:

- A `Counter` does not implement the [`.fromkeys()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dictionaries/fromkeys) method.
- The [`.update()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/dictionaries/update) method adds counter values rather than replacing them, making it the opposite of `.subtract()` above.

## Codebyte Example

The following example creates a `Counter` from an iterable (a string) and outputs various characteristics of the `Counter`:

```codebyte/python
import collections
c = collections.Counter("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")
print(f"Counter Collection: {c}\n")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted(c.elements())}\n")
print(f"5 Most Common Items: {c.most_common(5)}")
```

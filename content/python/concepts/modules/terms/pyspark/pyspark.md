**PySpark** is a Python [API](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/api) for Apache Spark (or Spark), consisting of several modules. Spark is an analytical engine for large-scale distributed data processing and [machine learning](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai/machine-learning). Spark applications can run operations with very large datasets on distributed clusters about 100 times faster than traditional Python applications. PySpark has seen wide usage in the [data science](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/data-science) and machine learning communities due to the extensive number of data science libraries available in Python, and its ability to efficiently process large datasets.

## Features

Some of the primary features of PySpark include:

- Distributed processing.
- Support of many cluster managers.
- Support of ANSI SQL.
- In-memory computation.

## Installation

Installation requires Java 8 or later. Details on installation can be found on the [Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/install.html).

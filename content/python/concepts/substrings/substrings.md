A Python **substring** is a sequence of characters that are part of an original [string](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings). In Python, substrings can be obtained by using the slicing feature on a string [variable](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/variables). A slice can be made in a specific position within the string, or it can be made at the default index.

## Syntax

A slice is made by using the open `[` and closed `]` square brackets next to a string variable. Inside the brackets, the position can be given:

```pseudo
string[start:end:step]
```

- `start` defaults to 0 and gives the initial position the slice will start from.
- `end` defaults to -1 and is the position where the slicing will end.
- `step` defaults to 1 and indicates the number of steps to take in between indexes.

## Examples

The following examples show different ways of obtaining substrings from an original string `name`.

```py
name = "Code Ninja"
```

### Retrieving Single Characters

When only one index is specified, a single character is returned. An index of `0` retrieves the first character of the string:

```py
print(name[0])

# Output: C
```

Negative numbers work on the string backwards. For example, index `-1` retrieves the last character of the string:

```py
print(name[-1])

# Output: a
```

### Negative Start Index

Using a negative start index (`-n`) with the default end value accesses the last `n` characters of the string. The following gives access to the last three characters of the string:

```py
print(name[-3:])

# Output: nja
```

### End Index

To specify only an end index, use `[:n]`, where `n` is the ending position. This will return the first `n` characters.

```py
print(name[:4])

# Output: Code
```

### Negative Step Value

Given a negative step value, returns the results backward:

```py
reversed = name[::-2]
print(reversed)

# Output: anNeo
```

### Keyword `in`

The `in` keyword can be used to check for a specific substring, like in the example below:

```py
print('de' in name)

# Output: True
```

### `.find()` Method

The string method [`.find()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings/find) can also be used to find a subset. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, it returns `-1`.

```codebyte/python
name = "Code Ninja"
print(name.find('ni'))
```

## Best practices for using substrings in Python

- **Use slicing for efficiency:** String slicing is optimized in Python and should be preferred over loops for extracting substrings.
- **Utilize `in` for membership checks:** The `in` operator is the most efficient way to check if a substring exists within a string.
- **Normalize case before comparisons:** Convert strings to lowercase or uppercase to avoid case-sensitive mismatches.
- **Handle missing substrings gracefully:** Use `.find()` instead of [`.index()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings/index) when searching for substrings to avoid exceptions.

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>1. What happens if the end index is beyond the string length in slicing?</summary>
<p>If the end index exceeds the string length, Python does not raise an error. It simply returns the available portion of the string.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. How can I check if a substring exists within a string?</summary>
<p>You can use the `in` operator or the `.find()` method. The `in` operator returns `True` or `False`, while `.find()` returns the starting index of the substring or `-1` if not found.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Why should I use `.find()` instead of `.index()`?</summary>
<p>The `.find()` method returns `-1` if the substring is not found, whereas `.index()` raises an exception. If you donâ€™t want to handle exceptions manually, `.find()` is a safer choice.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Can I use negative indexes for substring extraction?</summary>
<p>Yes, Python allows negative indexing, which counts from the end of the string. You can use negative values for both the start and end positions when slicing.</p>

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that combines the flexibility and general syntax of JavaScript with a type checker and syntax.
It's one of the fastest-growing and most popular languages on the web today.

Code written in TypeScript compiles to regular JavaScript.
Anything you write in TypeScript can be run wherever it could be in JavaScript: web browsers, Node servers, and more.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is three tools that build on each other:

1. A **language** specification that describes JavaScript syntax as well as new TypeScript-specific syntax
2. A **compiler** program that takes in TypeScript (and therefore also JavaScript) syntax and converts it to the equivalent JavaScript
3. A **type checker** program that reads in TypeScript syntax, understands the types of values every entity is meant to be, and notices any "type errors" (mismatches)
4. A **language server** that editors such as VS Code can run to provide development-time hints and refactoring tools

You can get started with an interactive playground provided by the TypeScript team at: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play.
It allows you to type in JavaScript or TypeScript code on the left and see the resultant output JavaScript or any TypeScript type errors.

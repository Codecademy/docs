**`SciPy`** is a widely used open-source [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-python-3) library that provides various scientific and numerical computing tools. Built on top of [NumPy’s](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy) robust array manipulation capabilities, SciPy extends Python with specialized modules for tasks such as optimization, signal processing, integration, statistics, image processing, and more. Its goal is to combine a consistent collection of high-level mathematical functions and algorithms so scientists, engineers, and data analysts can perform advanced computations efficiently, often without switching to lower-level languages like [C](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c).

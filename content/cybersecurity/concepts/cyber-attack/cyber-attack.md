**Cyber attacks** are attempts to disrupt or disable computer systems or steal valuable data. They will usually result in a violation of one of the principles of the CIA Triad:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

Cyber attacks can compromise sensitive data, including:

- Personal information such as social security numbers, government-issued documents, or medical information.
- Financial information such as credit card numbers and bank account numbers.

This can lead to consequences like identity theft, which is time-consuming, frustrating, and expensive to resolve.

## Types of Cyber Attacks

There are several types of cyber attacks. Some of the most common include:

- Malicious software like malware that can spy on someone unnoticed (spyware) or hijack entire systems (ransomware).
- Phishing scams where an email, text, or link could trick a user into sharing sensitive, private information.
- A "man-in-the-middle" (MitM) attack where the attacker intercepts a connection between multiple users.
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that overload a system's resources and bandwidth.
- SQL injections that corrupt or collect data from servers and databases.
- Zero-day vulnerabilities that exploit software vulnerabilities before they're patched.
- DNS tunneling that hides and removes the data of other programs in DNS queries and responses without being detected.

## Preventing Attacks

Organizations and individuals can and should take steps to prevent cyber attacks.

- Along with self-directed learning, organizations should educate employees on common cyber threats, including phishing and social engineering.
- Perimeter defenses, such as firewalls, should be installed and kept up to date.
- State-of-the-art antivirus software and malware detectors should be in place and continually updated to address threats.
- While patch management might seem tedious, it can help prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited.
- Strong user authentication and authortization practices, such as strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, should be utilized.
- Businesses should especially have a response plan to deal with security breaches.

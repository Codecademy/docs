**Social engineering** is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Unlike traditional cyber attacks that focus on technical vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the "human element" to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. It often exploits human emotions, such as fear and urgency, to trick targets into disclosing sensitive information like authentication credentials or credit card details.

## Common Techniques 

Social engineers use a variety of tactics to deceive their targets. These often involve creating a sense of urgency, fear, or trust

- **Phishing**: Sending fraudulent communications (usually emails) that appear to come from a reputable source to steal data or install malware.
- **Pretexting**: Creating a fabricated scenario (a pretext) to build trust and steal a victim's personal information.
- **Baiting**: Using a false promise to pique a victim's greed or curiosity, such as leaving a malware-infected USB stick in a public place. \* **Quid Pro Quo**: Promising a benefit in exchange for information, such as offering "technical support" in exchange for login credentials.
- **Tailgating**: Physically following an authorized person into a secure location.

## Social Engineering in Action

A typical example is an individual receiving an email claiming their account has been compromised. The message states the account will be deactivated unless they click a link to confirm their credit card details. This link navigates the victim to a fake website designed to harvest their sensitive information.

## Prevention & Defense

Protecting against social engineering requires a combination of skepticism, education, and established security protocols.

### How Businesses Protect Themselves

Businesses must educate and train employees across the organization to understand that they should not click on suspicious links or accept unusual offers, regardless of how legitimate an email appears.

### Quick Tips for Individuals

- **Think Before Clicking**: Attackers use urgency to make people act first and think later. Always verify the source of an urgent request.
- **Research The Sources**: Check domain links for spelling errors. Hover your cursor over a link to reveal the true destination URL before clicking.
- **Be Careful Downloading**: If you do not know the sender, do not open the message or attachments, as they may contain viruses or malware.
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Use MFA to ensure that a stolen password alone is not enough for an attacker to gain access.
- **Verification**: Always confirm the identity of someone requesting sensitive information through a secondary, trusted channel.

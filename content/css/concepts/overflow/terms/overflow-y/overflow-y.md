Defines how a block level element should handle content that goes beyond its y-axis boundary.

## Syntax

```css
overflow-y: <value>;
```

where `<value>` can be one of the following:

- `visible`: the default value. No content will be clipped and a scrollbar will not appear.
- `hidden`: content will be clipped and no scrollbar will appear.
- `scroll`: content will be clipped and a scrollbar will appear.
- `auto`: content will be clipped if it does not fit in the containing block, and a scrollbar will appear if it does.
- Keyword values: `initial`, `inherit`, `revert`, `unset`.

## Example 1

Clip any content that overflows without providing a scrollbar to view overflow content.

```css
.view-box {
  overflow-y: hidden;
}
```

## Example 2

Provide a scrollbar and clip any content that overflows.

```css
.view-box {
  overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

## Example 3

Provide a scrollbar only if overflow content exists.

```css
.view-box {
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

CSS inheritance describes how certain styles are initialized or computed depending on the CSS property and whether a value was set. Some properties are inherited with an initial, default value. Other properties are non-inherited and set to the computed value of its containing element by default.

## Inherited properties

Inherited properties apply to the element and its children.

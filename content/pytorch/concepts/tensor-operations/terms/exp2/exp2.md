The **`.exp2()`** function in PyTorch computes the base-2 exponential of each element in the input tensor. This function is useful for various mathematical operations and can be applied to tensors of any shape. The result is a new tensor with the same shape as the input, containing the base-2 exponentials of the input values.

## Syntax

```python
tensor.exp2()
```

Here's an example of how to use the .exp2() function in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compute the base-2 exponential
y = x.exp2()

print(y)
```

In this example, the .exp2() function is applied to the tensor `x`, and the result is stored in the tensor `y`. The output will be a tensor containing the base-2 exponentials of the elements in `x`.

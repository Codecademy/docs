In PyTorch, the **`.digamma()`** function computes the digamma function, which is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function. It is often used in statistics and machine learning, particularly in probabilistic models.

## Syntax

```pseudo
tensor.digamma()
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates the usage of the `.digamma()` function:

```py
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compute the digamma function
y = x.digamma()

print(y)
```

The above code produces the following output:

```shell
tensor([ 0.4228,  0.9228,  1.4228])
```

The **`.clamp()`** method in PyTorch limits tensor values to a specified range, setting elements below the minimum to the minimum and elements above the maximum to the maximum. It's used to normalize data or enforce constraints. PyTorch offers a functional version (`torch.clamp`), a tensor method (`.clamp`), and an in-place method (`.clamp_`).

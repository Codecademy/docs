**PyTorch** is an [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It provides a flexible ecosystem for deep learning and artificial intelligence research and production.

PyTorch is widely adopted in both academia and industry, competing closely with [TensorFlow](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/tensorflow) as a leading deep learning framework.

## Key Features

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dynamic Computational Graphs      | PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs, allowing for changes to network architecture during runtime.                                                                                                                               |
| Tensor Computation                | PyTorch offers a comprehensive library for tensor operations, similar to [NumPy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy), but with GPU acceleration.                                                                       |
| Deep Learning Support             | It includes modules for constructing deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.                                                                                                                                    |
| Autograd                          | PyTorch's automatic differentiation library, Autograd, enables easy computation of gradients, essential for training neural networks.                                                                                               |
| Rich Ecosystem                    | PyTorch has a thriving ecosystem with numerous libraries and tools, such as TorchVision for computer vision, TorchText for natural language processing, etc.                                                                        |
| Open-source and community support | PyTorch is open-source and actively maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). It has a large and active community providing support, contributing to discussions, and developing third-party tools and libraries. |

## Installation

PyTorch can be installed via pip, conda, or other package managers. Here's a common installation method using [pip](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/pip):

```shell
pip install torch
```

Visit the official PyTorch [installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) which provides detailed instructions tailored to specific operating systems and hardware configurations.

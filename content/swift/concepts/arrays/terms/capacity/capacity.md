The **`capacity`** of a Swift [array](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/swift/arrays) represents the amount of memory currently allocated to store elements without requiring a resize. If the number of elements exceeds this capacity, the array automatically reallocates memory, usually following an exponential growth patternâ€”to ensure efficient performance during appends.

## Syntax

```pseudo
array.capacity
```

**Parameters:**

`capacity` is a read-only property and does not take any parameters.

**Return value:**

Returns the number of elements the array can store in its currently allocated memory without reallocating.

## Example

The following code prints the array's initial capacity, appends elements, and then prints the updated capacity to show how Swift manages memory allocation dynamically:

```swift
var numbers: [Int] = []
print(numbers.capacity)

numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
numbers.append(3)
print(numbers.capacity)
```

The output of this code will be:

```shell
0
3
```

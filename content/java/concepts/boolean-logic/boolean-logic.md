The **boolean** data type is one of the eight primitive [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/data-types) in Java and is used to represent logical values. A boolean variable can hold only two possible values: `true` or `false`. It is commonly used to represent binary states such as on/off, yes/no, or enabled/disabled.

Building on this, **boolean logic** in Java refers to the use of boolean values in combination with logical operators like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) to evaluate conditions and control program behavior. This logic forms the backbone of decision-making in programmingâ€”guiding how a program responds to different inputs or situations. Boolean logic is widely used in conditional statements, loops, and validations, with practical applications such as form validation, user authentication, feature toggles, and game state control.

## Syntax

```pseudo
boolean variableName = value;
```

**Parameters:**

- `variableName`: The name of the boolean variable following Java naming conventions
- `value`: Either `true` or `false` (case-sensitive)

**Return value:**

A boolean data type does not return a value but stores a logical state that can be evaluated in expressions.

### Boolean Logical Operators

Boolean values can be combined and manipulated using logical operators:

- `&&` (AND): Returns `true` if both operands are `true`
- `||` (OR): Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`
- `!` (NOT): Returns the opposite boolean value
- `^` (XOR): Returns `true` if operands have different values

### Boolean Logical Methods

The Boolean wrapper class provides several useful methods for working with boolean values:

- `Boolean.parseBoolean(String s)`: Converts a string to a boolean value
- `Boolean.toString(boolean b)`: Converts a boolean to its string representation
- `Boolean.valueOf(boolean b)`: Returns a Boolean object representing the specified boolean value
- `Boolean.compare(boolean x, boolean y)`: Compares two boolean values

## Example 1: Basic Boolean Declaration

This example demonstrates the fundamental way to declare and use boolean variables in Java:

```java
public class BooleanBasics {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Declare boolean variables with initial values
    boolean isJavaFun = true;
    boolean isTestPassed = false;

    // Display the values
    System.out.println("Is Java fun? " + isJavaFun);
    System.out.println("Did the test pass? " + isTestPassed);

    // Boolean values from expressions
    boolean isPositive = (10 > 0);
    boolean isEqual = (5 == 3);

    System.out.println("Is 10 positive? " + isPositive);
    System.out.println("Is 5 equal to 3? " + isEqual);
  }
}
```

The output of this code is:

```shell
Is Java fun? true
Did the test pass? false
Is 10 positive? true
Is 5 equal to 3? false
```

This example shows how boolean variables can be declared with literal values (`true`/`false`) or assigned the result of boolean expressions. The comparison operators automatically return boolean values.

## Example 2: User Login Validation

This example demonstrates a real-world scenario where booleans are used to validate user credentials and control access to system features.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserLoginSystem {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    // Predefined user credentials
    String validUsername = "admin";
    String validPassword = "password123";

    System.out.print("Enter username: ");
    String inputUsername = scanner.nextLine();

    System.out.print("Enter password: ");
    String inputPassword = scanner.nextLine();

    // Boolean validation
    boolean isUsernameValid = inputUsername.equals(validUsername);
    boolean isPasswordValid = inputPassword.equals(validPassword);
    boolean isLoginSuccessful = isUsernameValid && isPasswordValid;

    // Display results
    System.out.println("Username valid: " + isUsernameValid);
    System.out.println("Password valid: " + isPasswordValid);

    if (isLoginSuccessful) {
      System.out.println("Login successful! Welcome to the system.");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Login failed. Please check your credentials.");
    }

    scanner.close();
  }
}
```

The output (with correct credentials) is as follows:

```shell
Enter username: admin
Enter password: password123
Username valid: true
Password valid: true
Login successful! Welcome to the system.
```

> **Note:** The output will vary depending on the username and password entered by the user during execution.

This example illustrates how booleans are used in authentication systems to validate user input and control access. The logical AND operator (`&&`) ensures that both conditions must be true for a successful login.

## Example 3: Shopping Cart Discount Calculator

This example shows how booleans can be used in e-commerce applications to determine eligibility for discounts and special offers:

```java
public class ShoppingCartDiscount {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Customer information
    double totalAmount = 120.50;
    boolean isPremiumMember = true;
    boolean hasPromoCode = false;
    int itemCount = 5;

    // Discount eligibility conditions
    boolean qualifiesForBulkDiscount = itemCount >= 5;
    boolean qualifiesForMemberDiscount = isPremiumMember;
    boolean qualifiesForPromoDiscount = hasPromoCode;
    boolean qualifiesForMinimumPurchase = totalAmount >= 100.0;

    // Determine applicable discounts
    boolean canApplyBulkDiscount = qualifiesForBulkDiscount && qualifiesForMinimumPurchase;
    boolean canApplyMemberDiscount = qualifiesForMemberDiscount;
    boolean canApplyPromoDiscount = qualifiesForPromoDiscount;

    // Calculate final discount
    double discountPercentage = 0.0;

    if (canApplyBulkDiscount) {
      discountPercentage += 10.0; // 10% bulk discount
    }

    if (canApplyMemberDiscount) {
      discountPercentage += 5.0; // 5% member discount
    }

    if (canApplyPromoDiscount) {
      discountPercentage += 15.0; // 15% promo discount
    }

    double discountAmount = totalAmount * (discountPercentage / 100);
    double finalAmount = totalAmount - discountAmount;

    // Display results
    System.out.println("=== Shopping Cart Summary ===");
    System.out.println("Original Amount: $" + totalAmount);
    System.out.println("Premium Member: " + isPremiumMember);
    System.out.println("Has Promo Code: " + hasPromoCode);
    System.out.println("Item Count: " + itemCount);
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Discount Eligibility:");
    System.out.println("Bulk Discount (5+ items, $100+ purchase): " + canApplyBulkDiscount);
    System.out.println("Member Discount: " + canApplyMemberDiscount);
    System.out.println("Promo Discount: " + canApplyPromoDiscount);
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Total Discount: " + discountPercentage + "%");
    System.out.println("Discount Amount: $" + String.format("%.2f", discountAmount));
    System.out.println("Final Amount: $" + String.format("%.2f", finalAmount));
  }
}
```

The output of this code is:

```shell
=== Shopping Cart Summary ===
Original Amount: $120.5
Premium Member: true
Has Promo Code: false
Item Count: 5

Discount Eligibility:
Bulk Discount (5+ items, $100+ purchase): true
Member Discount: true
Promo Discount: false

Total Discount: 15.0%
Discount Amount: $18.08
Final Amount: $102.43
```

This example demonstrates how booleans are used in business logic to evaluate multiple conditions and determine eligibility for various discounts. The boolean variables make the code readable and maintainable while handling complex business rules.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can boolean variables be assigned integer values like 1 or 0?

No, unlike some programming languages, Java boolean variables can only be assigned `true` or `false` values. Attempting to assign integer values like 1 or 0 will result in a compilation error. Java maintains strict type safety for boolean values.

### 2. What is the default value of a boolean variable?

For instance, for variables and static variables, the default value is `false`. However, local variables must be explicitly initialized before use, as they do not have default values.

### 3. Can boolean values be used in arithmetic operations?

No, boolean values cannot be directly used in arithmetic operations like addition or multiplication. Java does not perform automatic conversion between boolean and numeric types. To perform calculations with boolean values, you must first convert them explicitly.

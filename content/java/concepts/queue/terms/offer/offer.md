The **`.offer()`** method is part of the Java [`Queue`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/queue) interface and inserts an element at the end of the queue. It returns `true` if the element was added successfully, or `false` if the queue is at capacity and cannot accept new elements.

Unlike the [`add()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/queue/add) method, which throws an exception when the queue is full, `.offer()` fails, making it useful when there is a need to handle capacity limits without triggering exceptions.

## Syntax

```pseudo
queue.offer(element)
```

**Parameters:**

- `element`: The element to be inserted into the queue.

**Return value:**

- Returns `true` if the element was added successfully, `false` if the queue is full.

The `offer()` method is non-blocking, meaning it returns immediately if the queue is full. Instead of throwing an exception when capacity is reached, it returns `false`, making it safer for capacity-aware operations. Its behavior may vary between bounded and unbounded queue implementations.

## Example: Using `.offer()` in a Print Job Queue System

In this example, a bounded queue with capacity two demonstrates how `.offer()` returns `true` when adding elements within capacity and `false` when the queue is full:

```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue;

public class PrintJobQueue {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Queue<String> printQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2); // capacity of 2

    boolean added = printQueue.offer("Document1");
    System.out.println("Added Document1: " + added);

    added = printQueue.offer("Document2");
    System.out.println("Added Document2: " + added);

    // Attempt to add another job to a full queue
   added = printQueue.offer("Document3");
   System.out.println("Added Document3: " + added);
  }
}
```

The output generated by this code is:

```shell
Added Document1: true
Added Document2: true
Added Document3: false
```

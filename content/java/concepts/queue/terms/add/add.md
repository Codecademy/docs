The **`.add()`** method is a built-in method of the [`Queue`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/queue) interface in Java that inserts an element at the back of the `queue`. It returns true if the element is successfully added. Unlike `.offer()`, which returns false if the insertion fails, `.add()` throws an [`Exception`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors). This method is commonly used with implementations such as `LinkedList` and `ArrayDeque`.

## Syntax

```pseudo
queue_name.add(E element);
```

**Parameters:**

The `.add()` method requires an `element` as a parameter. The `E` is the type of the `element` parameter, which is the type of elements held in the `queue_name` [collection](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/collection).

**Return value:**

The `.add()` method returns `true` upon success. If the queue has a capacity limit and is full, `.add()` throws an `IllegalStateException`.

## Example

In this example, a `Queue` in Java is created using `LinkedList`, elements are added to it, and then the `.add()` method is used to insert an additional element at the end of the queue:

```java
import java.util.*;
class JAVA {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    Queue<Integer> myQueue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
    myQueue.add(5);
    myQueue.add(2);
    myQueue.add(11);
    myQueue.add(7);
    myQueue.add(8);

    // myQueue before adding 3: 5 => 2 => 11 => 7 => 8
    System.out.println("The elements in the queue are: " + myQueue);

    // adding 3 to myQueue
    boolean success = myQueue.add(3);
    System.out.println("3 inserted at the back of the queue: " + success);

    // myQueue after adding 3: 5 => 2 => 11 => 7 => 8 => 3
    System.out.println("The elements in the queue are: " + myQueue);
  }
}
```

The output generated by this code is:

```pseudo
The elements in the queue are: [5, 2, 11, 7, 8]
3 inserted at the back of the queue: true
The elements in the queue are: [5, 2, 11, 7, 8, 3]
```

Visual representation of the `.add()` method:

Below, the code "queue_name.add(3);" is shown, with an arrow pointing to the end of the queue. The bottom row shows the updated queue: 5, 2, 11, 7, 8, 3, illustrating that the number 3 was added to the end of the queue.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/media/java-queue-add.png)

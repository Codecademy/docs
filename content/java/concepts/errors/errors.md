In Java, situations where [things might go wrong in the program](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/error) are predominantly handled by the following subclasses of the `java.lang.Throwable` class: `Error` and `Exception`.

## Errors

The `Error` class represents illegal operations that cause serious abnormalities in the program and are not recommended to `catch`. Some examples include the following:

- The [`ClassFormatError`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/classformaterror) occurs when a class file cannot be read or interpreted.
- The [`IncompatibleClassChangeError`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/incompatibleclasschangeerror) occurs when a base class is altered after a child class has already been initialized.
- The [`NoClassDefFoundError`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/noclassdeffounderror) occurs when the file with the class containing the `main()` method cannot be found.

## Exceptions

The `Exception` class refers to abnormal and unexpected events that disrupt the flow of the program but can be reasonably handled by a `catch`-statement. Some examples include:

- The [`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/arrayindexoutofboundsexception) occurs when attempting to access an index that does not exist within a given array.
- The [`FileNotFoundException`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/filenotfoundexception) occurs when a file with the specified path cannot be found.
- The [`NumberFormatException`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/numberformatexception) occurs when an attempt is made to convert a string to a numeric type and the string contains non-numeric characters.
- The [`NullPointerException`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/errors/nullpointerexception) occurs when attempting to use a `null` value in place of where an object is required.

## Example

A `try...catch` block is a means for a programmer to encapsulate a block of code and "catch" a potentially-thrown `Exception` (but never an `Error`) before it halts the execution of the program.

In the example below, the code used in the `try` block will run until the `Exception` is thrown by the assignment to the `c` variable because division by zero, 0, is not possible. In the `catch` block, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown and yields a printed message along with details about where the `Exception` can be traced.

```java
class DivideByZero {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 27, b = 0;
    try {
      System.out.println("I'm executed first!");
      int c = a / b; // This will throw an exception
      System.out.println("I'm never executed!");
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Exception Caught!");
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
      System.out.println("Done!");
  }
}
```

When a programmer needs to handle more than one type of error, there are two common ways to do so, as follows:

```java
// Handle different errors separately
try {

} catch (Exception1 e) {

} catch (Exception2 e) {

}

// Handle different errors in the same way
try {

} catch (Exception1 | Exception2 e) {

}
```

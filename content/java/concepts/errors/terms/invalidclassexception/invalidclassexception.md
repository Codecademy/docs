The **`InvalidClassException`** occurs when the Serialization runtime detects a problem with a [class](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/classes). The problem can be one of the following:

- The serial version of the class does not match that of the class descriptor read from the stream.
- The class contains unknown [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/data-types).
- The class does not have an accessible [constructor](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/constructors) without arguments.

The **ImageFilter** module in the Pillow library provides a variety of predefined filters to enhance images, such as blurring, sharpening, and edge detection. These filters can be easily applied to images using the `filter` method of the `Image` class, enabling quick and effective image processing.

## Syntax

```pseudo
from PIL import ImageFilter
```

This statement imports the `ImageFilter` module from the Pillow library, which is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

In Pillow, the **`.transpose()`** method is used to flip or rotate an image in 90-degree steps.

## Syntax

```pseudo
Image.transpose(method)
```

- `Image`: Refers to the image object to which the transpose operations are to be applied.
- `method`: Specifies the type of transpose operation to perform. It can take one of the following values:
  - `Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT`: Flips the image horizontally (left to right).
  - `Image.FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM`: Flips the image vertically (top to bottom).
  - `Image.ROTATE_90`: Rotates the image by 90 degrees anticlockwise.
  - `Image.ROTATE_180`: Rotates the image by 180 degrees.
  - `Image.ROTATE_270`: Rotates the image by 270 degrees anticlockwise.
  - `Image.TRANSPOSE`: Transposes the image, which swaps the image's rows and columns.
  - `Image.TRANSVERSE`: Performs a diagonal flip from the bottom-left to the top-right of the image.

## Example

The following example demonstrates the use of the `.transpose()` method:

```py
import PIL
from PIL import Image

# Read the image
im = Image.open("bird-thumbnail.jpg")

# Display the original image
im.show()

# Flip image
out = im.transpose(PIL.Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT)

# Display the flipped image
out.show()
```

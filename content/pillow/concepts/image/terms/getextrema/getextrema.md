The **`.getextrema()`** method in the Pillow library quickly finds the minimum and maximum (darkest and brightest) pixel values in an image, showing the range of pixel intensities present.

## Syntax

```pseudo
Image.getextrema()
```

**Return value:**

- **For single-band images (e.g., grayscale):** Returns a tuple `(min, max)` showing the darkest and brightest pixel values.
- **For multi-band images (e.g., RGB or RGBA):** Returns a tuple of tuples like `((min_R, max_R), (min_G, max_G), (min_B, max_B))`, providing the minimum and maximum values for each color channel separately.

## Example

The image used in the example is:

![Funny Husky Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/docs/main/media/funny-husky.jpg)

The following example demonstrates the usage of the `.getextrema()` method:

```py
from PIL import Image

# Open the image file
cute_dog_image = Image.open("funny_husky.jpg")

# Get extrema for the image
extrema = cute_dog_image.getextrema()

print("Extrema of the image:", extrema)
```

Here is the output generated by this code:

```shell
Extrema of the image: ((0, 255), (0, 255), (0, 255))
```

### Usefulness of `.getextrema()`

- **Quick Overview of Pixel Value Range:** It provides a quick way to understand the overall contrast or brightness spread in an image. For example, if the extrema of a grayscale image are `(10, 245)`, this means the darkest pixel has a value of `10`, and the brightest pixel has a value of `245`, giving an insight into the image's contrast.

- **Preprocessing and Analysis:** Knowing the pixel value range is useful for several image processing tasks, such as:
  - Adjusting contrast to enhance image features.
  - Performing thresholding to segment objects based on pixel intensity.
  - Identifying potential saturation issues or underexposure in the image.

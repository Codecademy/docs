**`.fromarray()`** is a function from the Image module that is used to process images for more clarity. It creates a new image derived from a specified array.

## Syntax

```pseudo
Image.fromarray(obj_array, mode="CMYK")
```

`.fromarray()` takes two parameters:

- `obj_array`: It represents a defined array
- `mode`: It is an optional parameter that defines the type and depth of a pixel in the image that will be created. If `mode` is not used, the new image will be stored as is.

The `mode` parameter can take the following values:

- `CMYK`: It represents the color palette made from base colors Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key(black). Each color has an 8-bit pixel to store its value, which means `CMYK` has 4x8-bit pixels to store the values.
- `RGB`: It represents the color palette made from Red, Green, and Blue colors. It has 3x8-bit pixels available to store the values.
- `L`: It represents grayscale or shade of gray from white to black. It only has an 8-bit pixel to store its value.

## Example

The example below shows the value of a pixel in coordinate (0,0) after the parameter `mode` is used with `CMYK` as the value.

```py
# Import Image module from Pillow library
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Defined an array 300 by 36 with 200 as all the pixel values
obj_array = np.full((300, 36), 200)

# Create an image from the array, as our `obj_array' is stored in the form of a
# numbered array
new_imageA = Image.fromarray(obj_array, mode="CMYK")

# Show the image generated using .fromarray()
new_imageA.show()

# Show the pixel value by the coordinate
print(new_imageA.getpixel((0,0)))
```

The result proves that the obj_array has been successfully generated as new_imageA, and the pixel at coordinate (0,0) is stored as a CMYK color combination with the values shown below.

```shell
(200, 0, 0, 0)
```

## Codebyte Example

Run the following Codebyte example to understand how a new image is created from the specified array in the `RGB` color format.

```codebyte/python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Defined an array 3 by 3 with 200 as all the pixel values
obj_array = np.full((3, 3, 3), 200)

# Create an image from the array
new_imageB = Image.fromarray(obj_array, mode="RGB")

# Show the image generated using .fromarray()
new_imageB.show()

# Show the pixel value by the coordinate
print(new_imageB.getpixel((0,0)))
```

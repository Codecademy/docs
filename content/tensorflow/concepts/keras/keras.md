**Keras** is a high-level library used with TensorFlow in Python. It is used to create deep learning and neural network models. The purpose of this library is to allow developers to build machine learning applications efficiently.

## Foundations of Keras

The foundation of Keras revolves around its core components: layers and models. It facilitates every step of the model-building process, from loading and preprocessing datasets to stacking layers to form complete models, and evaluating the output of these models.

To begin building with functions within Keras, the following syntax is used:

```pseudo
tf.keras.relevantFunction()
```

Considering `tensorflow` is imported as `tf` and `relevantFunction()` is a function provided within the `keras` module in TensorFlow.

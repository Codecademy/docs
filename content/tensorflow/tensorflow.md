**TensorFlow** is a free and [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) library for [artificial intelligence](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai) and machine learning created by the Google Brain team. It is primarily used with [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python) but also supports other programming languages such as [C++](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp), [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript), etc. It provides an extensive collection of functions and APIs that can be used to build deep neural networks and deep learning models. To use TensorFlow, one can install the library by following the steps on the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) website.

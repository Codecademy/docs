# YAML

YAML (short for **YAML Ain’t Markup Language**) is a human-readable data serialization format. It is commonly used for configuration files, data exchange between languages with different data structures, and settings in development environments.

- **Supports complex data structures** – such as lists, maps, and nested data.
- **Language-agnostic** – supported across many programming languages.
- **Commonly used in**:
  - DevOps tools like Docker and Kubernetes
  - Static site generators

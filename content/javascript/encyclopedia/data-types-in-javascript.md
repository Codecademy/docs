Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:

- Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `1`, `-2`, `99`, `3.14`.
- String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `'...'` or double quotes `"..."`. Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.
- Boolean: This data type only has two possible values — either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
- Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).
- Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`.
- Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.
- Object: Collections of related data.

The first 6 of those types are considered primitive data types. They are the most basic data types in the language. Objects are a little more complex. 

At first, seven types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one.

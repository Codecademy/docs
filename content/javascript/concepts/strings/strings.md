**Strings** are a primitive data type. They are any grouping of characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes `'`, double quotes `"` or backticks `` ` ``.

## Concatenation

In JavaScript, multiple strings can be concatenated or joined together using the `+` [operator](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/operators).

In the example below, multiple strings and variables containing string values have been concatenated. After the code block is run, the `displayText` variable will contain the concatenated string:

```js
let service = 'credit card';
let month = 'May 30th';
let displayText = 'Your ' + service + ' bill is due on ' + month + '.';

console.log(displayText);
// Output: Your credit card bill is due on May 30th.
```

## Interpolation

String interpolation is the process of evaluating string literals containing one or more placeholders (expressions, variables, etc). It can be performed using template literals (`text ${expression} text`), as in the following example:

```js
let age = 7;

// String concatenation
console.log('Tommy is ' + age + ' years old.');
// Output: Tommy is 7 years old.

// String interpolation
console.log(`Tommy is ${age} years old.`);
// Output: Tommy is 7 years old.
```

## Escaping Characters

On occasion, it may be necessary to include characters in a string that may have reserved meanings or to apply additional formatting. Characters, such as quotes, can be included by prepending a `\`. There are a number of predefined escape sequences such as `\n` or `\t` to add formatting such as a line break or tab respectively:

```js
// Line break
console.log('Hello\nWorld');
// Output:
// Hello
// World

// Including quotes
console.log('"Wayne\'s World"');
// Output: "Wayne's World"
```

## Codebyte Example

The following codebyte example demonstrates how the above concepts work:

```codebyte/javascript
let year = '2024';
let sport = 'soccer';
let displayText = 'In ' + year + ', the sport ' + sport + ' is going to be played in the Olympics.';
console.log(displayText);

let Mary = 'Mary';
let Joe = 'Joe';
console.log(`${Mary} has the bananas and ${Joe} has the apples.`);

console.log('Hello\tWorld');
```

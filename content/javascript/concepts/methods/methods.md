In JavaScript, methods are object properties containing a function definition. Within the function definition, `this` can be used to refer to the containing object as long as the function is defined within the object.

**Note:** If a function is assigned to a property later, any reference to `this` will reflect the context of the new function. Also, if the object's function is assigned to a variable and executed via the variable, `this` will reflect the variable's execution context.

## Syntax

A method of an object is called via the following syntax:

```js
objectName.methodName();
```

If a method is called without parenthesis, it is being called as a property, which means it will return the function definition, not execute the method.

## Example

The following code snippet demonstrates how object methods work and how the context of `this` can affect the behavior of those methods when called in different ways:

```javascript
const car = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic',
  year: 2019,
  printOut: function () {
    console.log(this.year + ' ' + this.make + ' ' + this.model);
  },
};

car.printOut();

// Referenced as a property
var method = car.printOut;

car.year = 2020;

method();
// 'this' is being referenced outside an object context
// can be fixed by explicitly setting the object context with 'bind()'

method = car.printOut.bind(car);

method();
```

The above example returns the following output:

```shell
2019 Honda Civic
undefined undefined undefined
2020 Honda Civic
```

## Codebyte Example

The following code snippet illustrates how the context of `this` affects the behavior of methods within an object, and how it can be controlled using `bind()`:

```codebyte/javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  }
};

console.log(person.fullName());

const getFullName = person.fullName;

console.log(getFullName());

const getBoundFullName = person.fullName.bind(person);

console.log(getBoundFullName());
```

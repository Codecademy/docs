Variables are used whenever thereâ€™s a need to store a piece of data. A variable contains data that can be used in the program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can be used to replace the same value in multiple places.

```js
const currency = '$';
let userIncome = 85000;

console.log(currency + userIncome + ' is more than the average income.');
```

The code above produces the following output:

```shell
$85000 is more than the average income.
```

## Codebyte Example 1

Run the following codebyte example to understand the usage of variables in JavaScript:

```codebyte/javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 25;
let city = "Berlin";

// Using the variables multiple times in the program
console.log("Name: " + name);
console.log("Age: " + age);
console.log("City: " + city);

// Reusing the variables
console.log(name + " is " + age + " years old and lives in " + city + ".");
```

## Declaring a Variable

To declare a variable in JavaScript, any of these three keywords can be used along with a variable name:

- `var` is used in pre-ES6 versions of JavaScript. It is function scoped.
- `let` is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned. It is block scoped.
- `const` is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value. It is also block scoped.

```js
var age;
let weight;
const numberOfFingers = 20;
```

## Codebyte Example 2

Run the following codebyte example to understand how to declare variables in JavaScript:

```codebyte/javascript
// Using `var`
var animal = "giraffe";
console.log(animal);

animal = "elephant";
console.log(animal);

// Using `let`
let spaceship = "Falcon";
console.log(spaceship);

spaceship = "Starship";
console.log(spaceship);

//Using `const`
const favoritePlanet = "Earth";
console.log(favoritePlanet);

favoritePlanet = "Mars";
// Error! The variable "favoritePlanet" cannot be changed because it is a const.
```

## Dynamic Typing

Unlike many programming languages, JavaScript doesn't require the user to specify a variable's [data type](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/data-types). It assumes the data type based on the value. The example below assigns a string to a variable by enclosing some numbers in single quotation marks. Without them, JavaScript reads the value as a number.

```js
let movieTitle = '300'; // String
let audienceNumber = 300; // Number
```

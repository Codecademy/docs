Variables are used whenever there’s a need to store a piece of data. A variable contains data that can be used in the program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can be used to replace the same value in multiple places.

```js
const currency = '$';
let userIncome = 85000;

console.log(currency + userIncome + ' is more than the average income.');
// Output: $85000 is more than the average income.
```

## Declaring a Variable

To declare a variable in JavaScript, any of these three keywords can be used along with a variable name:

- `var` is used in pre-ES6 versions of JavaScript. It is function scoped.
- `let` is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned. It is block scoped.
- `const` is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value. It is also block scoped.

```js
var age;
let weight;
const numberOfFingers = 20;
```

## Dynamic typing

Unlike many programming languages, JavaScript doesn't force the user to specify a variable's data type. It assumes the data type based on the way a user assigns a value. For example, the example below assigns a string to a variable by putting the text between quotation marks. Without them, JavaScript reads it as a number. This is why it's considered to be a dynamically-typed language.

```js
let movieTitle = '300'; // String
let audienceNumber = 300; // Number
```

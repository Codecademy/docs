**Template literals** are [string](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/strings) literals in JavaScript that allow embedded expressions, multi-line strings, and more readable string formatting. Introduced in ES6, they make string manipulation more powerful and expressive than traditional concatenation.

Template literals are enclosed by **backticks** (`` ` ``) instead of single or double quotes.

## Syntax

Template literals use backticks (`` ` ``) to define the string. To embed expressions, use `${expression}` within the template literal. The syntax is as follows:

```pseudo
`string text`

`string text ${expression} string text`

`string text line 1
 string text line 2`
```

- Backticks (`` ` ``): Define the template literal.
- `${expression}`: Placeholder for JavaScript expressions, which can include variables, calculations, or function calls.
- Multi-line support: Line breaks within backticks are preserved, eliminating the need for `\n`.

## Basic Example

Template literals simplify string concatenation by allowing variables or expressions to be embedded directly:

````js
const name = "Oscar";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting);

The output of this code is:

```shell
Hello, Oscar!
````

In this example, the variable `name` is embedded using `${}`. This is more readable than traditional concatenation (`"Hello, " + name + "!"`).

## Multi-line Strings

Template literals make multi-line strings straightforward without needing explicit newline characters:

```js
const poem = `
  Roses are red,
  Violets are blue,
  JavaScript is fun,
  And so are you!
`;
console.log(poem);
```

The output for this is:

```shell

  Roses are red,
  Violets are blue,
  JavaScript is fun,
  And so are you!
```

The output preserves the line breaks as written, making it ideal for formatting text like HTML or poetry.

## Expression Interpolation

Template literals can include any valid JavaScript expression inside `${}`:

```js
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
const result = `The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}.`;
console.log(result);
```

The output here is:

```shell
The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.
```

Expressions can also include function calls or complex calculations:

```js
const getName = () => "Oscar";
const message = `Hi, ${getName()}! Your score is ${Math.random() * 100}.`;
console.log(message);
```

The output of this code is:

```shell
Hi, Oscar! Your score is 87.62799470776743.
```

## Tagged Template Literals

Template literals can be combined with a tag function to customize how the strings and expressions are processed:

```js
function myTag(strings, ...values) {
  return strings[0] + values[0].toUpperCase() + strings[1];
}
const name = "Oscar";
const tagged = myTag`Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(tagged);
```

The output of this code is:

```shell
Hello, OSCAR!
```

Here, `myTag` is a custom function that manipulates the template literalâ€™s parts. The `strings` parameter holds the static parts, and `values` contains the evaluated expressions.

## Codebyte Example

In this example, template literals are used to embed variables directly into a string. The placeholders `${user}` and `${age}` are replaced with their values when the string is evaluated, producing a readable, formatted output without using concatenation:

```codebyte/javasstring
const user = "Oscar";
const age = 25;
const info = `User: ${user}, Age: ${age}`;
console.log(info);
```

The ***resizeTo()*** function is used to change the size of a window to a new width and height.

## Syntax
```js
        window.resizeTo(width, height);
```

- `width` : It will be the new total number of pixels of the window width after the ***resizeTo*** function has been executed.

- `height` : It will be the new total number of pixels of the window height after the  ***resizeTo*** function has been executed.

## Example


```js
    window.resizeTo(298, 57)
```

The **`.defineProperties()`** method defines new or modifies existing properties directly on an object or adds multiple properties to an object at once. This method is often used for property descriptors and fine-grained control over object properties.

## Syntax

```pseudo
Object.defineProperties(object, descriptors)
```

- `object`: The object to define or modify its properties.
- `descriptors`: An object where each key represents a property name, and the corresponding value is the property descriptor. They have four optional keys:
  - `value`: Specifies the value of the property.
  - `writable`: A Boolean indicating whether the value of the property can be changed.
  - `get`: A function that serves as a getter for the property, called when the property is accessed.
  - `set`: A function that serves as a setter for the property, called when the property is assigned a new value.

## Example

In this example, `Object.defineProperties` defines two properties (`property1` and `property2`) on the `myObject` object. Each property has a descriptor object specifying attributes like `value` and `writable`:

```js
const myObject = {};

Object.defineProperties(myObject, {
  property1: {
    value: 42,
    writable: true,
  },
  property2: {
    value: 'Hello',
    writable: false,
  },
});

console.log(myObject.property1);
console.log(myObject.property2);

// Trying to modify the object

myObject.property1 = 100; // Works because property1 is writable
myObject.property2 = 'World'; // Doesn't work because property2 is not writable

console.log(myObject.property1);
console.log(myObject.property2);
```

This will return the following output:

```shell
42
Hello
100
Hello
```

## Codebyte Example

In this example, `computedProperty` is not a direct property with a fixed value. Instead, it is dynamically computed based on the private variable `_value`, and the `get` and `set` functions control its behavior. Try running the code block below to understand better how the `.defineProperties()` method works:

```codebyte/javascript
const myObject = {
  _value: 0,
};

Object.defineProperties(myObject, {
  computedProperty: {
    get: function () {
      return this._value * 2;
    },
    set: function (newValue) {
      this._value = newValue / 2;
    },
  },
});

console.log(myObject.computedProperty);

// Updating value of computedProperty
myObject.computedProperty = 10;

console.log(myObject.computedProperty);
```

> **Note:** This method is used when customizing the behavior of object properties or ensuring certain constraints on them.

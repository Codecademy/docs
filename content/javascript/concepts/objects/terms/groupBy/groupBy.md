The **`.groupBy()`** method groups items according to the value returned by a [callback function](https://codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/callbacks). The return value of the `.groupBy()` method is a null-prototype object that doesn't inherit any object methods.

## Syntax

```pseudo
Object.groupBy(items, callfunc);
```

- `items`: It is an array. They will be grouped according to the result of the `callfunc`.
- `callfunc`: It is a callback function. This function returns a string or a symbol.

## Example

In the following example, the code groups users by their subscription year:

```js
const subs = [
  { userName: 'Lisa', yearSub: 2022 },
  { userName: 'Akim', yearSub: 2020 },
  { userName: 'Lola', yearSub: 2020 },
];

const subsByYear = Object.groupBy(subs, (user) => {
  return user.yearSub;
});
```

> **Note:** To run this code, it is necessary to add a library like [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#groupBy).

The output of the above code will be:

```shell
{
  '2020': [
    { userName: 'Akim', yearSub: 2020 },
    { userName: 'Lola', yearSub: 2020 }
  ],
  '2022': [ { userName: 'Lisa', yearSub: 2022 } ]
}
```

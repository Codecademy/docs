The JavaScript date method **`.setMonth()`** changes the month according to the local time by modifying an instance of a `Date` object in place.

## Syntax

```pseudo
date.setMonth(monthValue);
date.setMonth(monthValue, dateValue);
```

- `monthValue`: An integer from `0` to `11` which represents the month. For example, `0` is for January and `11` is for December.
- `dateValue` (optional): An integer from `1` to `31`, which represents the day of the month.

If either `monthValue` or `dateValue` is outside the expected range, the other date information in the `Date` object is updated to account for the underflow or overflow. For example, when given 14 as the parameter for a `monthValue`, the year is incremented by 1, and the month is set to 2 (March).

If no value is provided for the `dateValue` parameter, the date value will not change unless there is an overflow. For example, calling `.setMonth(1)` to set the month to February on a Date object that was `1/31/2023` will result in overflow, and the date will be set to `3/3/2023`. This is because February only has 28 days.

The return value of `.setMonth()` is the new timestamp given after changing the `Date` object in place. If a given parameter is `NaN`, `undefined`, or otherwise invalid, the date object will return `NaN` (if printed, it will display `Invalid Date`).

## Example

This example shows multiple implementations of the `.setMonth()` function. First, the month alone is changed. Then, the month and date are changed. Last, the month and date are changed, but with an end of the month transition, leading to a date overflow.

```js
const event = new Date('1/1/2023');

// Setting the month alone
event.setMonth(2);
console.log(event.getMonth());
console.log(event);

// Setting the month and date
event.setMonth(2, 31);
console.log(event);

// Be mindful when dealing with the last day of the month!
event.setMonth(3, 31);
console.log(event);
```

The code above results in the following output:

```shell
2
2023-03-01T00:00:00.000Z
2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z
2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z
```

## Codebyte Example

This example is runnable and sets the `event` date to July:

```codebyte/javascript
const event = new Date('1/1/2023');

event.setMonth(6);

console.log(event);
```

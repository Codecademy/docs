When applied to a Date object, **`.toDateString()`** retrieves the date portion of the object's value, and returns a string representation of this date in a locale-specific format.

## Syntax

```pseudo
dateObject.toDateString()
```

## Example

In this example, a new instance of the `Date` object is created and stored in the variable, `date`. The `.toDateString()` method is then called on `date`, and the string returned is stored in `dateString` and printed out on the console:

```js
const date = new Date('December 5, 2023 8:53');
let dateString = date.toDateString();
console.log(dateString);
```

The above example will give the following output:

```shell
Tue Dec 05 2023
```

## Codebyte Example

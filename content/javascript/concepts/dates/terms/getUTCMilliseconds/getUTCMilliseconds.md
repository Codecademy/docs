The **`.getUTCMilliseconds()`** method returns the milliseconds for the provided `Date` object, according to universal time (not to be confused with the [`.getMilliseconds()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/dates/getMilliseconds) method).

## Syntax

```pseudo
myDate.getUTCMilliseconds()
```

The `.getUTCMilliseconds()` method will return an integer between 0 and 999, which represents the milliseconds for the given date, `myDate`, according to universal time.

The method will return `NaN` if the [date](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/dates) is invalid.

## Example

In the given example, `.getUTCMilliseconds()` is applied to the constant `selectedDate` and logged to the console.

```js
const selectedDate = new Date('2020-08-09T01:32:28.412+01:00');
console.log(selectedDate.getUTCMilliseconds());
```

The code will result in the following output:

```shell
  412
```

The `switch` statement evaluates an expression and allows different blocks of code to execute depending on the result of that expression. It contains any number of `case` clauses marking code to execute based on values returned by the expression, and an optional `default` statement marking code that executes if none of the `case` clauses are true.

The code following a matching `case` clause will execute until it encounters a `break` statement, a `return` statement, or the end of the `switch` block.

This means that if a `break` is omitted at the end of one `case` block, subsequent `case` blocks and/or the `default` block will be executed regardless of the value of the original expression.

## Syntax

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Statements executed when expression = value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Statements executed when expression = value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // Statements executed when expression = value3
    break;
  default:
  // Statements executed when expression not equal to value1, value2 or value3
}
```

With `break` statements omitted:

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
  // Statements executed when expression = value1
  case value2:
  // Statements executed when expression = value2 or value1
  case value3:
  // Statements executed when expression = value3, value2 or value1
  default:
  // Statements always executed
}
```

## Example

Determine whether a `rating` is a 5, 4, 3, or something else:

```js
switch (rating) {
  case 5:
    console.log('Excellent 👏');
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log('Good 👍');
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log('Fair 👌');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Poor 👎');
}
```

- If `rating` is 5, print `"Excellent 👏"`.
- If `rating` is 4, print `"Good 👍"`.
- If `rating` is 3, print `"Fair 👌"`.
- Else, print `"Poor 👎"`.

## Codebyte Example

Here, an expression is used to find whether a number is even, odd, or not a number:

```codebyte/js
var test = 3;

switch (test % 2) {
  case 0:
    console.log("Test is even.");
    break;
  case 1:
    console.log("Test is odd.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Test is not a number.");
}
```

The **binomial distribution** is a probability distribution representing the number of successful outcomes in a sequence of independent trials, where each trial can have only two possible results: success or failure. It is widely used in data science for modeling binary outcomes, such as predicting customer purchases, email click-through rates, or defect detection in quality control.

A binomial experiment must satisfy the following conditions:

- **Fixed Number of Trials**: The process is repeated a specific number of times.
- **Two Possible Outcomes Per Trial**: Each trial results in either success or failure.
- **Constant Probability of Success**: The probability of success remains the same in all trials.
- **Independent Trials**: The result of one trial does not affect the result of another.

The formula for computing the binomial distribution is given by:

$$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}$$

Where:

- $`X`$: A discrete random variable representing the number of successes.
- $`n`$: The total number of trials.
- $`k`$: The number of successes.
- $`p`$: The probability of obtaining a successful outcome in each trial.
- $`\binom{n}{k}`$: The binomial coefficient indicating the number of ways to choose $`k`$ successes from $`n`$ trials.

## Example

Suppose an e-commerce company analyzes customer behavior. They observe that, on average, 30% of visitors make a purchase on their website. If 10 visitors come to the website, what is the probability that exactly 3 customers make a purchase?

According to the binomial distribution formula:

- $`n`$ = 10 (The total number of visitors)
- $`k`$ = 3 (The number of customers making a purchase)
- $`p`$ = 30% or 0.3 (The probability of purchase for each visitor)

Therefore, the equation stands:

$$P(X = 3) = \binom{10}{3} (0.3)^3 (1 - 0.3)^{10 - 3}$$

The approximate value obtained after simplifying this equation is 0.2668 (or 26.68%).

So, the probability that exactly 3 out of 10 visitors make a purchase is approximately 26.68%.

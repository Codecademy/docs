[**Git**](https://git-scm.com) is a distributed version control system that allows a developer to track changes made to files in their projects. Teams of developers can use Git to collaborate on a single project at scale. This is made possible by branching, which allows developers to make specific changes to eventually be merged into the `main` branch of the codebase (or Git repository).

Created as a free and [open-source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source) tool by [Linus Torvalds](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/historical-technical-figures/linus-torvalds) in 2005 for development of the [Linux kernel](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/open-source/linux-kernel), Git is now a fundamental development tool used by almost all professional developers.

Installation instructions (for systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux) can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

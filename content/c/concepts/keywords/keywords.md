In C programming, **keywords** are fundamental building blocks. They are predefined and reserved by the language for specific functionalities, making it easier for programmers to write efficient and standard code. Keywords are part of the syntax and convey the compiler how to interpret a piece of code. Since they are reserved, they cannot be redefined or used for any other purpose.

C provides a small set of keywords compared to modern programming languages, ensuring simplicity and performance. Understanding keywords is essential for learning the language and using its features effectively.

## Key points about keywords

- Keywords are case-sensitive in C. For example, `if` and `If` are treated differently.
- There are 32 standard keywords in C.
- Keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.
- They provide specific instructions to the compiler to perform operations like branching, looping, data type definition, and memory management.
- Some compilers may introduce additional keywords as extensions, but these are non-standard.

## Table of Keywords

Keywords in C are indispensable for writing efficient and functional programs. They form the backbone of the language's syntax and provide instructions to the compiler for various operations. Understanding these reserved words is crucial for any programmer learning C, as it helps in creating structured and standard-compliant code. By mastering the use of keywords, you can unlock the full potential of the C programming language.

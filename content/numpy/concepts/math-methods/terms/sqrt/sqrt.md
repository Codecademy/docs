The **`.sqrt()`** function computes the positive square root of all elements in the input array. As a [universal function (ufunc)](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-are-ufuncs-in-numpy), it operates element-wise and returns an array of the same shape with square root values.

Widely used in fields like statistics, physics, engineering, and machine learning, `.sqrt()` is a powerful tool for performing efficient mathematical operations on numerical arrays of various shapes and data types.

## Syntax

```pseudo
numpy.sqrt(x, out=None, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None)
```

**Parameters:**

- `x`: The input array or scalar value for which to compute the square root.
- `out` (Optional): The output array where the result will be stored. Must have the same shape as input if provided.
- `where` (Optional): Boolean array or condition indicating where to calculate the sqrt. By default, it computes the sqrt for all elements (True).
- `casting` (Optional): Controls what kind of data casting may occur during computation.
- `order` (Optional): Memory layout of the output array.
- `dtype` (Optional): Data type of the output array.

**Return value:**

The function returns an array of the same shape as `x`, containing the positive square root of each element in the input array.

## Example 1: Basic Square Root Calculation

This example demonstrates how to use NumPy's `.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of each element in a 1D array:

```py
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
array1 = np.array([4, 9, 16, 25])

# Calculate square root of each element
result = np.sqrt(array1)

# Display the result
print("Original array:", array1)
print("Square root result:", result)
```

The output generated by this code is:

```shell
Original array: [ 4  9 16 25]
Square root result: [2. 3. 4. 5.]
```

The `.sqrt()` function processes each element independently, computing the square root and returning a new array with the results. Note that the output array contains floating-point numbers even if the input contains integers.

## Example 2: Computing Standard Deviation with `.sqrt()`

This example shows how to use the `.sqrt()` function in statistical calculations, specifically to compute the [standard deviation](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy/built-in-functions/std) of a dataset:

```py
import numpy as np

# Sample data points
data = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])

# Calculate the mean
mean = np.mean(data)

# Calculate deviations from the mean
deviations = data - mean

# Square the deviations
squared_dev = deviations ** 2

# Calculate the variance (mean of squared deviations)
variance = np.mean(squared_dev)

# Compute standard deviation using sqrt()
std_deviation = np.sqrt(variance)

print("Dataset:", data)
print("Mean:", mean)
print("Variance:", variance)
print("Standard Deviation:", std_deviation)

# Compare with NumPy's built-in function
print("NumPy's std function result:", np.std(data))
```

The output of this code is:

```shell
Dataset: [2 4 6 8]
Mean: 5.0
Variance: 5.0
Standard Deviation: 2.236067977499790
NumPy's std function result: 2.236067977499790
```

This example demonstrates how the `.sqrt()` function is used in computing standard deviation, a common statistical measure that indicates how spread out values are from the mean.

## Codebyte Example: Working with Complex and Negative Numbers

This code demonstrates how NumPy's `.sqrt()` function operates on 2D arrays, negative values, and with conditional application using the `where` parameter:

```codebyte/python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D array
array2d = np.array([[1, 4, 9], [16, 25, 36]])
print("Original 2D array:")
print(array2d)

# Calculate square root of each element in the 2D array
result2d = np.sqrt(array2d)
print("\nSquare root of 2D array:")
print(result2d)

# Handle negative values
neg_array = np.array([-1, -4, -9])
complex_result = np.sqrt(neg_array)
print("\nSquare root of negative values:")
print(complex_result)

# Use where parameter to calculate sqrt only for values >= 0
mixed_array = np.array([-4, 0, 4, 9, -16])
filtered_result = np.sqrt(mixed_array, where=mixed_array >= 0)
print("\nSelective square root calculation:")
print(filtered_result)
```

The example shows that `.sqrt()` works element-wise on 2D arrays, maintaining their shape. For negative numbers, it returns `nan` along with a warning, unless complex handling is specified. The `where` parameter allows selective square root computation based on a condition, such as non-negative values.

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>1. What happens when I apply `.sqrt()` to negative numbers?</summary>  
<p>By default, NumPy's `.sqrt()` returns `nan` and raises a warning when applied to negative numbers in real-valued arrays. To compute square roots of negative numbers, convert the input to a complex data type.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Can I use `.sqrt()` with arrays of different data types?</summary>
<p>Yes, NumPy automatically promotes data types as needed. However, be aware that the return type might differ from the input type, typically returning floating-point numbers.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What's the difference between [`math.sqrt()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/python/math-module/math-sqrt) and `numpy.sqrt()`?</summary>
<p>`math.sqrt()` works only on scalar values, while `numpy.sqrt()` works on both scalars and arrays, applying the operation element-wise to arrays.</p>

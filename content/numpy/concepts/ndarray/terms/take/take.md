The **`take()`** method returns elements from an array at specific indices.
Itâ€™s similar to regular indexing, but works across flattened or specified axes, and supports advanced indexing use cases.

## Syntax

```pseudo
ndarray.take(indices, axis=None, out=None, mode='raise')
```

**Parameters:**

- `indices`: The 0-based indices of elements to extract
- `axis` (Optional): Specifies the axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. If the axis is not specified, the cumsum is computed over the flattened array.
- `out` (Optional): An optional output array in which to store the resulting cumulative sum. The shape and buffer length must match that of the expected output but the type will be cast if necessary.
- `mode` (Optional): Specifies how out-of-boinds indices are handled
    - `'raise'` - raises an error (default)
    - `'wrap'` - wraps around
    - `'clip'` - clips to the valid range

**Return value:**

Returns an array containing the selected elements, or a reference to `out` if specified.


## Example 1

This example demostrates the use of ndarray.take():

```py
import numpy as np

array = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
result = arr.take([0, 3, 4])
print(result)
```

The output of this code is:

```shell
[10 40 50]
```

## Note: Selecting arbitary elements

The `take()` method can only extract elments along a single axis, it cannot directly select combinations of indices across multiple dimensions

For example:

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[10, 20, 30],
                [40, 50, 60],
                [70, 80, 90]])

# This won't work: cannot take (0,0) and (1,1) in one call
# arr.take([(0, 0), (1, 1)])  # Invalid

```

This code will throw a Syntax error

## Codebyte Example

In this example, we use ndarray.take() on a 2D array:

```codebyte/python
import numpy as np

#Create a 2D NumPy array
array = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60], [70, 80, 90]])
print("Original array:")
print(arr)

#Take elements along the first axis (rows)
row_elements = arr.take([0, 2], axis = 0)
print("\nElements from rows 0 and 2:")
print(row_elements)

# Take elements along the second axis (columns)
col_elements = arr.take([1,2], axis = 1)
print("\nElements from columns 1 and 2:")
print(col_elements)

#Take woth wrap mode (handles out-of-bounds index)
wrapped = arr.take([3, -1], mode = 'wrap')
print("\nUsing 'wrap' mode with out-of-range indices:")
print(wrapped)

```

The `.var()` [function](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/numpy/built-in-functions)Â computes the variance of the elements in an array, either across all elements or along a specified axis (if provided). Variance is a statistical measurement that shows how far each number in the array is spread out from the _mean_. In other words, it measures the dispersion or spread in the data.

A high variance indicates that the numbers in the array are far from the _mean_, while a low variance indicates that they are close to the _mean_.

## Syntax

```pseudo
numpy.var(array, axis=None)
```

- `array`: The array for which the variance is to be calculated.
- `axis`: An optional parameter that specifies the axis along which the variance is to be calculated.

If `axis` is not specified, the variance is calculated for the entire (flattened) array. If `axis` is specified, then the variance is calculated along that axis. For a 2D array, if `axis=0`, the variance is calculated column-wise, and if `axis=1`, the variance is calculated row-wise.

## Example

The following example creates a 2D array and calculates the overall variance (variance of the flattened array), column-wise variance, and row-wise variance of the array using the `.var()` function:

```py
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]])

# Calculating the overall variance
overall_variance = np.var(array_2d)
print(overall_variance)

# Calculating the column-wise variance (axis=0)
column_variance = np.var(array_2d, axis=0)
print(column_variance)

# Calculating the row-wise variance (axis=1)
row_variance = np.var(array_2d, axis=1)
print(row_variance)
```

This produces the following output:

```shell
6.666666666666667
[6. 6. 6.]
[0.66666667 0.66666667 0.66666667]
```

## Codebyte Example

The following codebyte example demonstrates how to calculate the variance of a 2D array:

```codebyte/python
import numpy as np

# Creating a 2D array
arr = [[2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
[15, 6, 27, 8, 2],
[23, 2, 54, 1, 2, ],
[11, 44, 34, 7, 2]]

# Calculating the variance of the flattened array
print("\nvar of arr, axis = None : ", np.var(arr))

# Calculating the variance along axis = 0
print("\nvar of arr, axis = 0 : ", np.var(arr, axis = 0))

# Calculating the variance along axis = 1
print("\nvar of arr, axis = 1 : ", np.var(arr, axis = 1))
```

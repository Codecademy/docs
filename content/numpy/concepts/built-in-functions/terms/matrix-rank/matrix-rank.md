## Introduction

The `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank()` function computes the rank of a matrix, which is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated by its columns (column rank) or rows (row rank), which are always equal. It represents the number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.

Matrix rank is crucial for understanding:

- The solutions to systems of linear equations
- The invertibility of matrices (a matrix is invertible if its rank equals its dimension)
- The dimensionality of the image space of a linear transformation

## Syntax

```python
numpy.linalg.matrix_rank(A, tol=None, hermitian=False)

##example

import numpy as np

# Create a matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])

# Compute matrix rank
rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print("Rank of matrix A:", rank)  # Output: 2 (since the third row is a linear combination of the first two)

##codebyte example
import numpy as np

# Create a 4x4 matrix with rank 2
B = np.array([[1, 2, 0, 3],
              [0, 0, 1, 4],
              [1, 2, 0, 3],  # Duplicate of first row
              [0, 0, 1, 4]]) # Duplicate of second row

# Compute and print the rank
print("Rank of matrix B:", np.linalg.matrix_rank(B))

# Create an identity matrix (full rank)
I = np.eye(3)
print("Rank of identity matrix:", np.linalg.matrix_rank(I))
```

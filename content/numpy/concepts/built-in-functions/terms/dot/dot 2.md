In NumPy, the **`.dot()`** method computes the dot product of two arrays. For 1-D arrays, it provides a scalar value. When both arrays are 2-D, it performs matrix multiplication, resulting in a new 2-D array. Further details about various scenarios, including arrays with more than two dimensions, can be found in the NumPy [`.dot()` documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html). This method is widely utilized in linear algebra and numerical computations.

## Syntax

```pseudo
numpy.dot(a, b, out=None)
```

- `a`: The first array, which could be 1-D, 2-D, or higher dimensional.
- `b`: The second array, having compatible dimensions with `a`, and also could be 1-D, 2-D, or higher dimensional.
- `out`: Optional parameter that specifies the output array where the result is stored. If not provided, a new array is created.

## Example

The usage of the `.dot()` method is demonstrated in the following example:

```py
import numpy as np

# Define two arrays
array_a = [3,4,5]
array_b = [1,2,3]

# Compute the dot product and print the result
print(np.dot(array_a, array_b))
```

The above code will produce the following output:

```shell
26
```

## Codebyte Example

```codebyte/python
import numpy as np

m = [[3, 5], [1, 4], [5, 4]]
n = [[7, 3, 1], [2, 7, 2]]

print("Matrix m :")
print(m)

print("Matrix n :")
print(n)

result = np.dot(m, n)

print("The dot product of matrix m and n is :")
print(result)
```

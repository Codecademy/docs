The **`.inv()`** function inverts a given matrix and returns the inverted matrix. If the inversion fails or the given matrix is not a square matrix, then it raises an `LinAlgError`. Some of its use cases in the field of statistical analysis include:

- Linear Regression
- Multivariate Analysis
- Bayesian Statistics

## Syntax

```pseudo
numpy.linalg.inv(a)
```

- `a`: The matrix to be inverted.

## Example

The following example demonstrates the usage of the `.inv()` function:

```py
import numpy as np

array =  np.array([[2., 3.], [1., 4.]])
array2 = np.array([[[2., 3.], [1., 4.]], [[6., 4.], [10., 10.]]])

# The determinant is bigger then zero since the above matrices are non-singular

print("One matrix: ")
print(np.linalg.inv(array))

print("\nTwo matrices: ")
print(np.linalg.inv(array2))
```

The output for the above code is as follows:

```shell
One matrix:
[[ 0.8 -0.6]
 [-0.2  0.4]]

Two matrices:
[[[ 0.8 -0.6]
  [-0.2  0.4]]

 [[ 0.5 -0.2]
  [-0.5  0.3]]]
```

## Codebyte Example

Run the following codebyte example of the `.inv()` function, to better understand its working:

```codebyte/py
import numpy as np

array =  np.array([[2., 4.], [1., 2.]])

# The determinant is zero since the above matrix is singular

print(np.linalg.inv(array))
```

> **Note:** The `.inv()` function raises an `LinAlgError` when a singular matrix is passed for inversion, as it can't be inverted.

The **`AND`** operator tests if all conditions in a given expression evaluate to `TRUE`.

## Syntax

```pseudo
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1
  AND condition2
  ...
  AND conditionN;
```

If any of the `condition_`s evaluate to `NOT TRUE`, then the entire `WHERE` clause will not return the desired `column_`s.

## Example

The following example filters the current students with GPA higher than 3.0 for the rest of the `students` table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE enrolled_status = 'current' AND overall_gpa >= 3.0
```

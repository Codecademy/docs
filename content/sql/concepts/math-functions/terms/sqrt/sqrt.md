**`SQRT()`** is a function in SQL that returns the square root of a number input. The square root of any given number is a value that multiplied by itself will result in the passed number.

## Syntax

```sql
SQRT(number);
```

`number` in this case should be any positive integer. For example, 144 as seen below.

## Example

The square root of 144 is 12, as 12 multiplied by 12 equals 144. It is important to note, `SQRT()` requires a positive number, and will always return a positive number.

```sql
SELECT SQRT(144);
```

Yields:

```shell
12
```

> **Note:** SQRT() is compatible with different SQL database platforms such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

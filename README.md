## What is Codepedia?
Codepedia is intended to be a free, easily accessible reference for coding terms and concepts available to learners the world over. If you forget what JavaScript hoisting is, we want you to be able to look up "JS hoisting" on any search engine, click a Codepedia entry as the first result, and have an answer in seconds.

To make the Codepedia vision clearer, [we even created a demo site](https://codecademy.github.io/codepedia/)! The UI is liable to change a lot, but the basic principles are there. 

## What stage of development are we in right now?
Right now we're trying to create a baseline of great content. We have an engineering team work on improving the UI of Codepedia in Q2, after which we'll put the content and the UI together and release to the world!


## How can I contribute?
Before contributing, please read through the files in [/documentation](https://github.com/Codecademy/codepedia-content/tree/main/documentation). There you'll find a write-up of our standards for content and style, as well as templates for creating your entries. Next, check out what entries need to be created in [the assignment sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e31MNRVTo5VijcuPFjqWymw8_A1BbShGEW_LuCqXZZA/edit#gid=0), put your name next to one, create it, and submit a pull request!

## Additional Notes
- Please prioritize all course and skill path work over Codepedia. Codepedia is a great way to fit in extra hours, but only when you don’t have higher priority work to do!
- Please use the ’Codepedia” Boomr Project for time spent on this content.
- Remember, if you ever have any questions at all, we're there to help in #codepedia-production.

# This is the security documentation for Codecademy

### **Description:** This document outlines the guidelines to follow if you come across a security breach.

1. We don't permit any security testing that attempts to degrade, interrupt, or deny service (DoS) to our users.
2. Vulnerability research doesn't extend to accessing or modifying user data that doesn't belong to the researcher. All testing should be conducted against accounts that are under a researcher's control.
3. We will make every attempt to respond in a timely manner as follows:

- Acknowledgement of the vulnerability report
- Timeframe for fixing the issue
- Notification that the issue has been fixed

Please do not submit vulnerabilities on any Codecademy forum, community spaces, or comment pages. We expect researchers to keep the details of the vulnerability private until a fix is released.

Please [email our Customer Support](https://help.codecademy.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) team with a brief description of the vulnerability you've discovered along with your Bugcrowd email address so you may be invited to the program.

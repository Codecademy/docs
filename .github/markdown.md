# Javascript notes

## Notes, warnings, and callouts

Writers can use the GFM alerts syntax to call special attention to content. There are three types of alerts: notes, warnings, and callouts.

Note: MDN Web Docs supported alerts with its own syntax prior to support for GFM alerts, and referred to them as "noteblocks". MDN does not support the following GFM alerts: [!TIP], [!CAUTION], [!IMPORTANT]. GFM does not support [!CALLOUT].

To add a note, create a blockquote whose first line is [!NOTE].
To add a warning, create a blockquote whose first line is [!WARNING].
To add a callout, create a blockquote whose first line is [!CALLOUT].
